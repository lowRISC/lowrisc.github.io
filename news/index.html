CAMBRIDGE, United Kingdom – October 20, 2023 – lowRISC C.I.C., the open source system on chip (SoC) organization, today announced the commercial availability of two pieces of hardware crucial for research and development with OpenTitan, a project creating the world’s first open source silicon root of trust (RoT) designs. The NAE-CW310-K410T (Bergen Board) and the new, larger NAE-CW340-OTKIT (Luna Board) are now available for purchase exclusively from trusted global distributor Mouser, and addresses the overwhelming demand from OpenTitan partners, organizations and academic institutions wanting to run the full OpenTitan design — or subcomponents of that design — in a flexible FPGA-based emulation platform.</p><p><a href=/news/2023/10/cw340-announcement/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/news/2023/09/dsbd-cheriot-announcement/>lowRISC Extends UKRI’s Digital Security by Design Programme Support Into Operational Technology</a></h2><h5><time>September 12, 2023</time></h5><p class=text-justify>UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) recently announced that its CHERI-based Digital Security by Design Programme (DSbD) technologies have already demonstrated significant value in sectors where high integrity, resilient, and safety-focused applications are paramount, including avionics, automotive and embedded systems.
DSbD aims to provide foundational support to developers centred around a technology enhancement in the central processor (CPU): Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions, or (CHERI). CHERI has the potential to prevent around 2/3rds of current exploits, whilst simultaneously providing new software methods to help maintain the operational resilience and integrity of applications.</p><p><a href=/news/2023/09/dsbd-cheriot-announcement/>Read More…</a></p></div><img class="align-self-center rounded ml-3 d-none d-md-block" alt=OpenTitan title=OpenTitan srcset="/news/2023/09/dsbd-cheriot-announcement/eev-diagram_hu6537a0223bf0667bfd0fa04f80fa1c8a_143870_150x0_resize_box_2.png 1x, /news/2023/09/dsbd-cheriot-announcement/eev-diagram_hu6537a0223bf0667bfd0fa04f80fa1c8a_143870_300x0_resize_box_2.png 2x" src=/news/2023/09/dsbd-cheriot-announcement/eev-diagram_hu6537a0223bf0667bfd0fa04f80fa1c8a_143870_150x0_resize_box_2.png></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/news/2023/07/ibex-inside-how-and-why-we-built-opentitans-risc-v-core/>Ibex Inside: How and Why We Built OpenTitan’s RISC-V Core</a></h2><h5><time>July 17, 2023</time></h5><p class=text-justify>OpenTitan® recently announced the RTL freeze of Earl Grey, the first chip tapeout of its open source silicon root of trust (RoT). The first engineering samples should be in our hands before the end of the year.
OpenTitan&rsquo;s mission is to provide a secure root of trust, which is complemented by a secure processor core. To address this need, we elevated one of the most widely deployed, highest quality RISC-V cores in academia to the industrial-level of quality characteristic of this project.</p><p><a href=/news/2023/07/ibex-inside-how-and-why-we-built-opentitans-risc-v-core/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/news/2023/06/opentitans-rtl-freeze-leveraging-transparency-to-create-trustworthy-computing/>OpenTitan’s RTL Freeze - Leveraging Transparency to Create Trustworthy Computing</a></h2><h5><time>June 16, 2023</time></h5><p class=text-justify>We are delighted to announce an important development for OpenTitan®: RTL Freeze for the Earl Grey discrete, the first OpenTitan chip tapeout. This milestone is a source of immense pride for lowRISC and our OpenTitan partners, because it’s a concrete demonstration of the success of the Silicon Commons™ approach to making silicon radically more transparent and trustworthy.
In partnership with Nuvoton, a major TPM vendor, this RTL freeze means that the OpenTitan coalition will have engineering samples of the discrete silicon root of trust (RoT) this calendar year.</p><p><a href=/news/2023/06/opentitans-rtl-freeze-leveraging-transparency-to-create-trustworthy-computing/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/news/2023/04/a-major-milestone-for-opentitan/>A Major Milestone for OpenTitan</a></h2><h5><time>April 20, 2023</time></h5><p class=text-justify>We are excited to announce today that the OpenTitan project has hit a major tapeout milestone: a feature freeze of its open-source RTL.
Together with our partners, we began the OpenTitan project in 2019 with the goal of producing the world’s first open-source silicon Root of Trust (RoT). With this new achievement we are a step closer to realising that goal.
Getting to this point has taken a lot of coordinated work, as we&rsquo;ve had to navigate the many stumbling blocks that have traditionally made open-source silicon development a challenge.</p><p><a href=/news/2023/04/a-major-milestone-for-opentitan/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><div class=lr-blog-list-pagination><ul class=pagination><li class=page-item><a href=/news/ class=page-link aria-label=First><span aria-hidden=true>&laquo;&laquo;</span></a></li><li class="page-item disabled"><a class=page-link aria-label=Previous><span aria-hidden=true>&laquo;</span></a></li><li class="page-item active"><a class=page-link href=/news/>1</a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/news/page/2/>2</a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/news/page/3/>3</a></li><li class="page-item disabled"><span aria-hidden=true>&nbsp;&hellip;&nbsp;</span></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/news/page/8/>8</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/news/page/2/ class=page-link aria-label=Next><span aria-hidden=true>&raquo;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/news/page/8/ class=page-link aria-label=Last><span aria-hidden=true>&raquo;&raquo;</span></a></li></ul></div></div></main><footer class=lr-footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-2 d-none d-lg-block"><img src=/img/logo/logo-dualcolor.svg width=150px></div><div class=col><p><small>The text content on this website is licensed under a <a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>, except where otherwise noted.
