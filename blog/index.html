Eckert holds the chair for IT Security in the Department of Computer Science at Technical University of Munich (TUM) and is director of the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied and Integrated Security (AISEC) in Munich, overseeing more than 220 researchers.</p><p><a href=/blog/2022/10/claudia-eckert-joins-board/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/blog/2022/08/security-verification-of-an-open-source-hardware-root-of-trust/>Security Verification of an Open Source Hardware Root of Trust</a></h2><p class=text-justify>OpenTitan is a powerful open source silicon root of trust project, designed from scratch as a transparent, trustworthy and secure implementation for enterprises, platform providers and chip manufacturers. Featuring numerous hardware security features ranging from secure boot and remote attestation to secure storage of private user data. The open source development model allows OpenTitan to serve as a vehicle for innovation in academia, but also as an effective commercial platform as well.</p><p><a href=/blog/2022/08/security-verification-of-an-open-source-hardware-root-of-trust/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/blog/2022/06/lowrisc-acquires-newae/>lowRISC Acquires NewAE Technology, Adding Advanced Security Analysis Tools to the OpenTitan Platform</a></h2><p class=text-justify>lowRISC C.I.C., the open source organization dedicated to bringing secure collaborative innovation to silicon development, today announced the acquisition of NewAE Technology, Inc., a privately-held designer and manufacturer of broadly accessible silicon security analysis tools.
The acquisition brings added momentum to lowRISC, whose OpenTitan project – a collaboration between lowRISC, Google, Western Digital, Seagate and other commercial and academic partners – has created the first transparent, high-quality reference design and integration guidelines for silicon root of trust (RoT) chips.</p><p><a href=/blog/2022/06/lowrisc-acquires-newae/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/blog/2021/06/andy-hopper-knighted-for-services-to-computer-technology/>Andy Hopper knighted for services to Computer Technology</a></h2><p class=text-justify>lowRISC is delighted that Andy Hopper, lowRISC&rsquo;s independent chair, has been knighted for services to Computer Technology.
Andy said &ldquo;As you might imagine I am delighted. What I have achieved is all a result of teamwork. The University of Cambridge and the Cambridge Cluster have provided a wonderfully collaborative and flexible environment within which I have had the good fortune to work for over 40 years.&rdquo;
The culture he created, and his interest in and support for doing things in non-standard ways, has helped to establish over 200 start-ups, including lowRISC CIC.</p><p><a href=/blog/2021/06/andy-hopper-knighted-for-services-to-computer-technology/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/blog/2020/12/opentitan-at-one-year/>OpenTitan at One Year</a></h2><p class=text-justify>Last year, along with our partners, lowRISC announced OpenTitan, the world’s first open source silicon root of trust. The project has progressed rapidly since then. A recent Google Security Blog post detailed key milestones met, our growth in contributors, and revealed news of the first commercial OpenTitan tapeout.
OpenTitan’s success demonstrates the value of the lowRISC collaborative engineering model, wherein our full-stack engineering team allows us to serve as an essential development hub.</p><p><a href=/blog/2020/12/opentitan-at-one-year/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/blog/2020/10/a-birthday-present-for-lowrisc-we-won-an-openuk-award/>A birthday present for lowRISC: We won an OpenUK Award!</a></h2><p class=text-justify>On October 20th, lowRISC CIC won in the Open Hardware category at the 2020 OpenUK Awards, describing lowRISC as &ldquo;the jewel in the crown of the UK’s open silicon companies&rdquo;. The OpenUK awards promote &ldquo;UK Leadership in Open Technology&rdquo;, and are given out by OpenUK, a UK-based not-for-profit company which supports open source collaboration and open technologies within the United Kingdom.
On receiving the award, lowRISC CTO, Alex Bradbury, said &ldquo;We&rsquo;re incredibly grateful to have been recognised for our achievements and contributions to date.</p><p><a href=/blog/2020/10/a-birthday-present-for-lowrisc-we-won-an-openuk-award/>Read More…</a></p></div><img class="align-self-center rounded ml-3 d-none d-md-block" alt="lowRISC's 2020 OpenUK Award" title="lowRISC's 2020 OpenUK Award" srcset="/blog/2020/10/a-birthday-present-for-lowrisc-we-won-an-openuk-award/lowrisc-openuk-award_hu102d7995d2b963f22702224878f2b063_388619_150x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 1x, /blog/2020/10/a-birthday-present-for-lowrisc-we-won-an-openuk-award/lowrisc-openuk-award_hu102d7995d2b963f22702224878f2b063_388619_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 2x" src=/blog/2020/10/a-birthday-present-for-lowrisc-we-won-an-openuk-award/lowrisc-openuk-award_hu102d7995d2b963f22702224878f2b063_388619_150x0_resize_q75_box.jpg></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/blog/2020/10/how-we-used-differential-testing-to-rapidly-find-and-fix-missed-optimisation-opportunities-in-llvms-risc-v-backend/>How we used differential testing to rapidly find and fix missed optimisation opportunities in LLVM&#39;s RISC-V backend</a></h2><p class=text-justify>At this October 2020 LLVM Developers&rsquo; Meeting I presented a poster about how, with a surprisingly simple tool, we were able to rapidly identify, isolate, and fix a range of missed optimisation opportunities in LLVM&rsquo;s RISC-V backend.
The tool works by generating random C programs, compiling each program with both Clang and GCC (targeting RISC-V) and comparing the assembly generated by both compilers. If it estimates that Clang/LLVM generated worse code than GCC then it saves that case for further analysis.</p><p><a href=/blog/2020/10/how-we-used-differential-testing-to-rapidly-find-and-fix-missed-optimisation-opportunities-in-llvms-risc-v-backend/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/blog/2020/09/gsoc-projects-successfully-completed/>GSoC Projects Successfully Completed</a></h2><p class=text-justify>Time is ticking and summer is almost over already.

The GSoC initiative gives students the opportunity to spend the summer break gaining real-world hardware and software development experience while earning a stipend from Google. If you&rsquo;re a student interested in applying, we strongly recommend you read up on how GSoC works and study the Google Summer of Code Student Guide, which contains excellent advice on preparing a high quality proposal.</p><p><a href=/blog/2020/03/students-for-gsoc-projects-wanted/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><div class=lr-blog-list-pagination><ul class=pagination><li class=page-item><a href=/blog/ class=page-link aria-label=First><span aria-hidden=true>&laquo;&laquo;</span></a></li><li class="page-item disabled"><a class=page-link aria-label=Previous><span aria-hidden=true>&laquo;</span></a></li><li class="page-item active"><a class=page-link href=/blog/>1</a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/blog/page/2/>2</a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/blog/page/3/>3</a></li><li class="page-item disabled"><span aria-hidden=true>&nbsp;&hellip;&nbsp;</span></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/blog/page/7/>7</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/blog/page/2/ class=page-link aria-label=Next><span aria-hidden=true>&raquo;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/blog/page/7/ class=page-link aria-label=Last><span aria-hidden=true>&raquo;&raquo;</span></a></li></ul></div></div></main><footer class=lr-footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-2 d-none d-lg-block"><img src=/img/logo/logo-dualcolor.svg width=150px></div><div class=col><p><small>The text content on this website is licensed under a <a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>, except where otherwise noted.
