Policies are set by tagging data/instructions in memory and modifying a 64-bit
control register called <code>tagctrl</code>. More details about tagged memory can be
found in the <a href=https://www.lowrisc.org/docs/minion-v0.4/tag_core/>tagged memory section</a>
of the tutorial for release 0.4 and in the initial lowRISC memo.</p><p>The goal of this internship was to implement OS support for user processes
using lowRISC&rsquo;s tagged memory. This task had several parts. At minimum,
multiple processes have to be able to use tags without interfering with each
other. I also wanted to support tags being read in from a file for file-backed
memory. Finally, I explored some ways that user programs might interface with
the tagged memory infrastructure, such as tagging valid branch targets.</p><p>I modified both Spike and the Linux kernel throughout the project, and my
changes can be found in branches of <a href=https://github.com/lowrisc/>lowRISC&rsquo;s Github
repos</a> (full details at the end of this
document). Hopefully, my work will enable experimentation with different ways
user processes might use tagged memory as a basic implementation for others to
build on.</p><h2 id=supporting-multiple-processes:690c1b1b29c6028e839b62fe98e8623a>Supporting multiple processes</h2><p>To support multiple processes, I modified typical kernel abstractions used to
provide process isolation. Specifically, this involved modifying the context
switch code as well as certain aspects of the paging system. Tags on general
purpose registers (GPRs) as well as the <code>tagctrl</code> register become part of a
process&rsquo;s state, so they need to be preserved on context switch. Paging gives
each process the illusion of its own address space, but in reality, physical
pages might be shared or reallocated. When physical pages are shared for
copy-on-write, tags must be copied along with data and when pages are
reallocated, tags must be cleared.</p><h3 id=context-switch:690c1b1b29c6028e839b62fe98e8623a>Context switch</h3><p>When a context switch occurs, the value of <code>tagctrl</code> and any tags set on the
GPRs must be saved. Additionally, when saving GPRs, <code>tagctrl</code> must be set to
make sure tags are propagated appropriately and tag exceptions are disabled
when performing these stores. Therefore, the context switch code must:</p><ul><li>Save the old <code>tagctrl</code> value</li><li>Set <code>tagctrl</code> to enable safe propagation of all tags upon store</li><li>Save GPRs</li><li>Restore <code>tagctrl</code></li></ul><h4 id=overview:690c1b1b29c6028e839b62fe98e8623a>Overview</h4><p>We decided on modifying the definition of the <code>tagctrl</code> register from release
4 to make it easier to reason about tag policies at different privilege
levels. The <code>tagctrl</code> register is now unaliased and there are 3 different
<code>tagctrl</code> registers (<code>utagctrl</code>, <code>stagctrl</code>, and <code>mtagctrl</code>) with each
privilege level using a different <code>tagctrl</code> register: U-mode uses <code>utagctrl</code>,
S-mode uses <code>stagctrl</code>, and M-mode uses <code>mtagctrl</code>.</p><p>Saving the old <code>tagctrl</code> value and setting <code>tagctrl</code> to enable safe
propagation of tags turned out to be quite a tricky problem. Because there is
no CSR to CSR move instruction, this sort of movement requires going through a
GPR. When you context switch however, no GPRs are available, so you must spill
a register before doing anything. Spilling a GPR to the stack though has the
potential to cause exceptions. After trying several different solutions, we
decided on adding extra scratch CSRs to spill a GPR to when saving the
<code>tagctrl</code> registers.</p><h4 id=spike-modifications:690c1b1b29c6028e839b62fe98e8623a>Spike modifications</h4><p>I began by modifying Spike to have separate <code>utagctrl</code>/<code>stagctrl</code>/<code>mtagctrl</code>
registers. To determine which one should be used for tag checking, I also
modified instruction wrappers to check privilege level and use the appropriate
one.</p><p>I added extra scratch CSRs <code>stagctrl_scratch</code>/<code>mtagctrl_scratch</code> for use in
saving and restoring <code>stagctrl</code>/<code>mtagctrl</code> on entry to a different privilege
level before setting it to save GPRs. This was not strictly a Spike change,
because it also involved modifying the encoding.</p><p>Finally, I modified Spike to propagate tags to/from certain CSRs. While this
was for allowing tags to be propagated to the new scratch CSRs, it also
brought the Spike implementation more in line with the FPGA implementation of
tags on CSRs. The CSRs which propagate tags are listed in the tagged memory
section of release 4.</p><h4 id=software-modifications:690c1b1b29c6028e839b62fe98e8623a>Software modifications</h4><p>In the kernel, to save <code>utagctrl</code> of a process and <code>stagctrl</code>, two new fields
(<code>utagctrl</code> and <code>stagctrl</code>) were added to the <code>pt_reg</code> struct. I then modified
the macros to save and restore <code>stagctrl</code> as appropriate and set <code>stagctrl</code> to
disable tag exceptions and to propagate tags on load and store before saving
all the GPRs.</p><p>In BBL, I made similar modifications to the entry and exit code except using
<code>mtagctrl_scratch</code> and <code>mtagctrl</code>. Saving registers is also done just via
stack offsets. On every entry to machine mode, the stack pointer is decreased
by <code>INTEGER_CONTEXT_SIZE + TAG_CONTEXT_SIZE</code> to make room to save registers,
so I added extra space on the stack to save <code>mtagctrl</code> and <code>utagctrl</code>.</p><p>Even with the extra CSRs, this ends up being quite a fiddly process to make
sure that <code>stagctrl</code>/<code>mtagctrl</code> are saved in a way that won&rsquo;t cause exceptions
and without clobbering any data.</p><h3 id=paging:690c1b1b29c6028e839b62fe98e8623a>Paging</h3><h4 id=copy-on-write-pages:690c1b1b29c6028e839b62fe98e8623a>Copy-on-write pages</h4><p>Copy on write is a way for multiple processes to share a physical page even
when the process thinks the page isn&rsquo;t shared. The most common use of this is
for forking processes. The child has a separate copy of the parent&rsquo;s address
space. However, the parent and the child can share the same pages until one of
the processes writes to the page, at which point, a copy is actually made.
Because the copied page should be indistinguishable from the original, the
kernel needs to make sure tags are copied with the data.</p><p>Copy-on-write is handled as a specific type of page fault, so supporting
copy-on-write involves modifying a couple of functions used in the page fault
handling code for copy-on-write faults. I modified the function used for
copying data for copy-on-write to have it copy tags as well</p><h4 id=clearing-pages:690c1b1b29c6028e839b62fe98e8623a>Clearing pages</h4><p>To make sure tags don&rsquo;t leak from one process to another, either for security
reasons or to avoid exceptions, tags need to be cleared from pages before they
are reallocated to a different process. I modified the function used to clear
pages before allocation to set the tags to 0.</p><p>Performance impact of these changes is negligible, because only a couple of
constant time operations were added in each case.</p><h2 id=delivering-tag-exceptions-to-user-space:690c1b1b29c6028e839b62fe98e8623a>Delivering Tag Exceptions to user space</h2><p>As part of using tags in user programs, we would like to be able to able to
deliver tag exceptions to user space and trace back to the source of the
exception. We decided to piggyback off of the signal infrastructure used in
the Linux kernel and added a new code to distinguish a tag exception from
other exceptions causing a <code>SIGILL</code>.</p><p>Under the current implementation, Spike generates a trap with the same cause
(<code>CAUSE_TAG_CHECK_FAIL</code>) for every tag exception. You can identify that a tag
exception has occurred in the kernel via <code>scause</code> (and then pass that to
userspace via signal). The user program can also get the faulting address from
the siginfo struct. However, it is impossible to identify what kind of tag
exception occurred unless you go and read the opcode of the instruction that
it faulted on. Implementing this would involve changing the ABI, and we
decided we did not want to make extensive changes to the ABI at this point</p><h2 id=tags-on-elf-binaries:690c1b1b29c6028e839b62fe98e8623a>Tags on ELF binaries</h2><p>We then wanted to define a mechanism for reading in tags from a file for file
mapped memory. For this project, we decided to implement this by modifying ELF
binaries. Future work might involve constructing a tagged filesystem, but for
compatibility and portability we decided on ELF binaries. Currently, the
kernel supports both tagged and non-tagged binaries and tagged binaries can
run on non-tagged architectures. We currently support only static binaries</p><h3 id=modified-binaries:690c1b1b29c6028e839b62fe98e8623a>Modified binaries</h3><p>I decided to modify ELF binaries by adding a section with tags in it. To focus
primarily on getting it working, I implemented the tags section as a flat
array where there is a byte (a tag only uses 4 of the 8 bits) for each word in
the ELF binary&rsquo;s virtual address space. The tag corresponding to a certain
address can be retrieved by indexing into this section with the address.</p><h3 id=kernel-modifications:690c1b1b29c6028e839b62fe98e8623a>Kernel modifications</h3><p>Because we want to set tags whenever memory whenever we page fault a page in,
I modified the page-in code used in the kernel. The code checks if the virtual
memory it faulted on is mapped to an ELF binary. If it is, it then checks for
a tag section on the binary. If it finds it, then it reads in the appropriate
tags.</p><p>We considered several ways other read in tags. In particular, we considered
modifying the user space loader to set tags dynamically similar to how it
resolves library functions dynamically. However, we want to set tags whenever
we page fault and the user space loader does not know when page faults occur.
Thus, this method would have required us to define some sort of interface
between the user and the kernel</p><h3 id=future-work:690c1b1b29c6028e839b62fe98e8623a>Future work</h3><p>This method of reading in tags from a file is not meant to be the final
implementation. From a storage and performance perspective, there are a lot of
improvements that can be made. In particular, it would be good to work on a
more compact representation of the .tags section. Also, the current method of
reading in the .tags section causes several extra disk reads on every page
fault, which is quite a high performance overhead. This implementation also
doesn&rsquo;t support dynamic binaries and shared libraries, so future work could
focus on implementing support for these as well.</p><h2 id=tags-on-branch-targets:690c1b1b29c6028e839b62fe98e8623a>Tags on branch targets</h2><p>Tagged memory can be used to implement a simple form of control flow integrity
by tagging valid branch targets. My focus was not so much deriving a scheme
for control flow integrity as setting up the infrastructure to support a CFI
scheme, which involved modifying Spike to support branch tag checking and
logging branch targets.</p><h3 id=spike-modifications-1:690c1b1b29c6028e839b62fe98e8623a>Spike modifications</h3><p>I modified branch and jump instructions in Spike to tag the next PC and
implement checks defined as defined in release 4. I also modified the loop
that Spike uses to run instructions to <code>check pc_tag</code> and <code>insn_tag</code> when
running as defined in release 0.4. However, because Spike doesn&rsquo;t really
implement a tag pipeline, the point this check takes place isn&rsquo;t identical to
the hardware tag pipeline implementation <a href=https://www.lowrisc.org/docs/minion-v0.4/tag_core/>detailed in the v0.4 lowRISC
release</a>.</p><h3 id=capturing-branch-targets:690c1b1b29c6028e839b62fe98e8623a>Capturing branch targets</h3><p>To log branch targets, I added print statements to branch and jump
instructions in Spike to print out their targets to <code>stderr</code> if the processor
is executing in user-mode.</p><h2 id=demoing-new-functionality:690c1b1b29c6028e839b62fe98e8623a>Demoing New Functionality</h2><p>I implemented a basic framework to put together demos. It is a bit clunky and
hasn&rsquo;t been tested extensively for corner cases, but it works well enough to
run a demo testing out the added functionality. The basic strategy is to run a
program in Spike, log the branch targets, and then tag those branch targets in
the ELF binary. This doesn&rsquo;t tag all possible targets, but should give
something reasonably realistic for a simple demo or even benchmark.</p><p>Note that you do need to be careful about how you set up the program for
tracing, so the actual run of the program matches the trace. In particular, I
had to be careful with the <code>tagctrl</code> register. Ideally, you want to be able to
leave control checks off while running the trace. However, setting the
<code>tagctrl</code> register can add some extra instructions, so it may be necessary to
turn off branch exceptions in Spike instead,.</p><h3 id=using-the-framework:690c1b1b29c6028e839b62fe98e8623a>Using the Framework</h3><ol><li>Run Spike, making sure to redirect <code>stderr</code> to a file for the trace<ul><li>This means the Spike debug interface is not available, but if you’re
logging branch targets, probably everything is running well enough that you
shouldn&rsquo;t need the debug interface</li></ul></li><li>Boot Spike, run your binary in Spike at the command line. Run only your
binary in Spike, because currently there is no way to distinguish branch
targets from different processes</li><li>Exit Spike and run <code>./parse_trace.sh</code><ul><li><code>parse_trace</code> takes a raw trace file and outputs all the branch targets
between two addresses sorted in ascending order, eliminating duplicate
targets. The output is meant to be used by <code>elf_tagger</code></li><li>Usage: <code>./parse_trace [input file][output file][lower limit][higher limit]</code></li></ul></li><li>Run <code>elf_tagger</code>. You may want to add this step to <code>make_root_spike.sh</code>
after you compile your target binary, to ensure the .tags section is always
the right size.<ul><li><code>elf_tagger</code> takes an ELF binary and a sorted list of tag targets to
produce tag section of the right size for an ELF binary. Tags the
appropriate words based on the addresses given as targets</li><li>Usage: <code>./elf_tagger [binary] [output tag file] [targets]</code></li></ul></li><li>Run <code>riscv-unknown-linux-gnu-objcopy --add-section .tags=[tag file] [ELF
binary]</code> to add the <code>.tags</code> section to the binary</li><li>Run tagged binary in Spike</li></ol><h3 id=tests:690c1b1b29c6028e839b62fe98e8623a>Tests</h3><p>I have modified a couple of basic examples to be used as examples of this
framework. <code>stack_elf_tagged.c</code> and <code>ptr_elf_tagged.c</code> can both be run with
the instructions above and then used in Spike. Branch tags protect against a
buffer overflow attack overwriting a return address on the stack in
<code>stack_elf_tagged</code> and protect against a buffer overflow overwriting a
function pointer in <code>ptr_elf_tagged.c</code>.</p><h2 id=future-work-1:690c1b1b29c6028e839b62fe98e8623a>Future Work</h2><h3 id=signal-handling:690c1b1b29c6028e839b62fe98e8623a>Signal handling</h3><p>To fully support tag exceptions where we are able to figure out exactly what
caused the tag exception, we most likely want to have Spike generate traps
with different causes for each tag exception. These traps can be caught in the
kernel and then passed up to the user signal handler via new codes or a
new/modified field in the <code>siginfo</code> struct.</p><h3 id=swap-debugging-swap:690c1b1b29c6028e839b62fe98e8623a>Swap/debugging swap</h3><p>Because tagging data on disk is not supported either in the swap system or the
hardware, tags on memory must be harvested from the pages and saved manually
and then restored when the page is swapped back in. Questions that must be
addressed include where to store the saved tags and when to save and restore
tags to pages</p><p>Some prior work has been done in this area by the
<a href=http://agl.cs.unm.edu/~crandall/p359-crandall.pdf>Minos</a>,
<a href="https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/11287/UFO%20A%20General-Purpose%20User-Mode%20Memory%20Protection%20Technique%20for%20Application%20Use.pdf?sequence=2">UFO</a>,
and <a href=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/>CHERI</a> projects.
All of these works use data structures in kernel memory to save tags for
swapped out memory, harvesting the tags on page-out and restoring the tags on
page in.</p><p>Similar to prior works, I chose to start by storing tags in memory, using a
flat array to store all the tags for the pages in the swap space. This is
quite expensive from a memory perspective, and there are optimizations
available for future work. However, the main roadblock is in getting swap
working and testing it.</p><p>Because Spike doesn&rsquo;t support block devices, I set up a ramdisk as a block
device. Using the brd module, I created a ramdisk and formatted it as an ext2
file system. I then created a file on the ramdisk to use as a swapfile.
However, I found that writing to the swapfile at all has the potential to
corrupt the ext2 filesystem. The corruption isn&rsquo;t consistent (though it
happens more often than not) and can occur at different points during testing.
It&rsquo;s unclear as of now whether this is a kernel bug or a Spike bug.</p><p>As this issue is not specific to tagged memory, I tried to test a similar
configuration on FPGA to see if I would run into the same problem. However, it
kept freezing when I put my swapfile on the SD card, and it started writing to
the swap file. I also tried to do it with a ramdisk, but the boot process hung
when it was supposed to be loading the brd module, so likely there is some
issue with ramdisk on FPGA.</p><h3 id=libc-modifications:690c1b1b29c6028e839b62fe98e8623a>libc Modifications</h3><p>Supporting user programs will also mean modifying some common library
functions such as <code>memcpy</code>, <code>memset</code>, etc. to treat tags &ldquo;properly&rdquo;. The exact
desired behaviour will depend on the tagging use-case. It may be enough to
define simple versions of the functions that move tags in addition to data and
users select which version of the function to use. Alternately, a more
complex scheme may be needed where some bits in the page table or in the tag
itself determines whether or not the tags are copied with the data.</p><p>CHERI has defined modified versions of certain library functions which could
be helpful to reference in future implementations of library functions for
lowRISC.</p><h2 id=github-repos:690c1b1b29c6028e839b62fe98e8623a>Github Repos</h2><ul><li><a href=https://github.com/lowRISC/riscv-linux/tree/ctxswitch_with_tags>riscv-linux</a><ul><li>Changes to support properly saving/restoring user context on entry/exit
