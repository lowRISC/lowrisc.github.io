A few weeks in to their new roles, they each share thoughts on what attracted them to work at lowRISC.
Pirmin:
&ldquo;After having traveled around the world for 6 months, I finally started my new position as hardware/software engineer at lowRISC C.I.C. in Cambridge at the beginning of May. At lowRISC, we are working on open-source hardware/software ecosystems with a fully open-sourced, Linux-capable, RISC-V-based SoC being the ultimate goal.</p><p><a href=/news/2019/06/introducing-pirmin-laura/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/news/2019/05/onwards-and-upwards-at-lowrisc/>Onwards and upwards at lowRISC</a></h2><h5><time>May 16, 2019</time></h5><p class=text-justify>If you haven&rsquo;t checked it out yet, be sure to take a look at our press release and the corresponding Google blog post. This industry support and growth of our board is a huge step forwards for lowRISC. As Royal Hansen, vice president of Security, Google, said:
"Google believes that open source is good for everyone. To further our commitment, we are investing both capital and engineering resources to create a sustainable open source hardware ecosystem.</p><p><a href=/news/2019/05/onwards-and-upwards-at-lowrisc/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/news/2019/05/lowrisc-expands-press-release/>lowRISC Expands and Appoints New Members to the Board of Directors from Google and ETH Zurich</a></h2><h5><time>May 16, 2019</time></h5><p class=text-justify>London, England - lowRISC C.I.C., the open source system on a chip (SoC) organisation, today announced that Prof. Luca Benini (ETH Zurich), Dominic Rizzo (Google) and Ron Minnich (Google) have joined its board of directors.

Imagination Technologies were co-hosting with SiFive, and we heard from both companies. Krste Asanovic, chairman of the board at the RISC-V Foundation, gave a great introduction to RISC-V and progress so far. Naveed Sherwani, CEO of SiFive, talked us through their silicon design platform and future services.

We&rsquo;ve also taken the opportunity to re-organise our documentation, adding an easy to follow quick-start guide.
Our next development focus is to add support for dropping in the Ariane RISC-V design (from ETH Zurich) as an alternative to Rocket.</p><p><a href=/news/2018/11/lowrisc-0-6-milestone-release/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/news/2018/05/barcelona-risc-v-workshop-day-two/>Barcelona RISC-V Workshop: Day Two</a></h2><h5><time>May 9, 2018</time></h5><p class=text-justify>The eighth RISC-V workshop is continuing today in Barcleona.

Introduction: Rick O&rsquo;Connor This workshop has 325 attendees representing 101 companies and 25 universties. Largest outside of Silicon Valley.

The various changes are best described in our accompanying documentation, but the main focus is the integration of open-source Ethernet IP. The tutorial demonstrates how to use Ethernet support to boot with an NFS root, as well as with a rootfs on SD card.
Our main development focus currently is migrating to a newer version of the upstream Rocket chip design and reintegrating our changes on top of that, but we felt that the integration of Ethernet support merits a release before that change.</p><p><a href=/news/2018/01/lowrisc-0-5-milestone-release/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/news/2017/11/seventh-risc-v-workshop-day-two/>Seventh RISC-V Workshop: Day Two</a></h2><h5><time>November 29, 2017</time></h5><p class=text-justify>The seventh RISC-V workshop is concluding today at Western Digital in Milpitas.
