Could we create a more future-proof chip by embedding an FPGA fabric into it? Could we measure glucose levels more accurately by integrating a small bio lab onto a chip? Could we more reliably recognize kittens in a set of pictures by implementing neural network inference in hardware?
In implementation, this dream becomes a piece of hardware, with digital or analog logic, sensors, actuators, and much more.</p><p><a href=/blog/2019/06/an-update-on-ibex-our-microcontroller-class-cpu-core/>Read More…</a></p></div><img class="align-self-center rounded ml-3 d-none d-md-block" alt="Ibex block diagram" title="Ibex block diagram" srcset="/blog/2019/06/an-update-on-ibex-our-microcontroller-class-cpu-core/Ibex_block_diagram-100619_hu64d0b4d86cd0ba0563db9df884419228_38933_150x0_resize_box_2.png 1x, /blog/2019/06/an-update-on-ibex-our-microcontroller-class-cpu-core/Ibex_block_diagram-100619_hu64d0b4d86cd0ba0563db9df884419228_38933_300x0_resize_box_2.png 2x" src=/blog/2019/06/an-update-on-ibex-our-microcontroller-class-cpu-core/Ibex_block_diagram-100619_hu64d0b4d86cd0ba0563db9df884419228_38933_150x0_resize_box_2.png></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/blog/2019/06/introducing-pirmin-laura/>Introducing Pirmin &amp; Laura</a></h2><p class=text-justify>Pirmin Vogel and Laura James both joined lowRISC on May 1st this year.

Introduction: Rick O&rsquo;Connor This workshop has 325 attendees representing 101 companies and 25 universties. Largest outside of Silicon Valley. Rick gives the usual overview of the RISC-V Foundation structure.</p><p><a href=/blog/2018/05/barcelona-risc-v-workshop-day-one/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/blog/2018/01/lowrisc-0-5-milestone-release/>lowRISC 0-5 milestone release</a></h2><p class=text-justify>The lowRISC 0.5 milestone release is now available. The various changes are best described in our accompanying documentation, but the main focus is the integration of open-source Ethernet IP. The tutorial demonstrates how to use Ethernet support to boot with an NFS root, as well as with a rootfs on SD card.
Our main development focus currently is migrating to a newer version of the upstream Rocket chip design and reintegrating our changes on top of that, but we felt that the integration of Ethernet support merits a release before that change.</p><p><a href=/blog/2018/01/lowrisc-0-5-milestone-release/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><div class=lr-blog-list-pagination><ul class=pagination><li class=page-item><a href=/blog/ class=page-link aria-label=First><span aria-hidden=true>&laquo;&laquo;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/blog/page/2/ class=page-link aria-label=Previous><span aria-hidden=true>&laquo;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/blog/>1</a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/blog/page/2/>2</a></li><li class="page-item active"><a class=page-link href=/blog/page/3/>3</a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/blog/page/4/>4</a></li><li class="page-item disabled"><span aria-hidden=true>&nbsp;&hellip;&nbsp;</span></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/blog/page/6/>6</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/blog/page/4/ class=page-link aria-label=Next><span aria-hidden=true>&raquo;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/blog/page/6/ class=page-link aria-label=Last><span aria-hidden=true>&raquo;&raquo;</span></a></li></ul></div></div></main><footer class=lr-footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-2 d-none d-lg-block"><img src=/img/logo/logo-dualcolor.svg width=150px></div><div class=col><p><small>The text content on this website is licensed under a <a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>, except where otherwise noted.
