CICs have all the flexibility and certainty of a regular company, but with special features to ensure they are working for the benefit of the community. A social enterprise is a business with “for-good” objectives whose surpluses are reinvested for that purpose in the business or in the community. (Find out more about CICs on the gov.uk site.) lowRISC C.I.C. does not have shares, so we don’t pay dividends, and any surpluses are reinvested in our work.</p><p>While permissive licensing is used for hardware and software design artefacts, it remains necessary to protect trademarks, and certification has a key role to play. This is where lowRISC as a vendor neutral not-for-profit provides an independent home for holding intellectual property rights, and either directly operating, or specifying and overseeing the operation of certification programmes.</p><p>As a not-for-profit company, lowRISC can act as a neutral home for projects and multi-party corporate collaborations, and is a trustworthy steward for open source designs and tools.</p></div></section><section><div class=col-md-2><h2 class=lr-sectionheader-left>How does lowRISC fund its activities?</h2></div><div class=col><p>lowRISC is sustainable thanks to a business model where partners contribute engineering effort and funding, ideally as part of a multi-year commitment, often targeted at particular projects. This is further supported by work-for-hire where this directly contributes to the development of strategic open source technologies and best practices.</p><p>Surplus resource is used to support lowRISC’s wider aims and community. We also receive support from grants, donations and consultancy.</p></section><section><div class=col-md-2><h2 class=lr-sectionheader-left>Bigger than the sum of our parts</h2></div><div class=col><p>Our model and approach allows us to have significant impact, regardless of our team size.
