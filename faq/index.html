<h4 id="do-you-have-a-discussion-list:4a1318da06786ac52626178ca960109e">Do you have a discussion list?</h4>

<p>Yes, you can now <a href="http://listmaster.pepperfish.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/lowrisc-dev-lists.lowrisc.org">subscribe
  to lowrisc-dev</a> and view archives <a href="http://listmaster.pepperfish.net/pipermail/lowrisc-dev-lists.lowrisc.org/">here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="are-you-hiring:4a1318da06786ac52626178ca960109e">Are you hiring?</h4>

<p>We aren&rsquo;t currently advertising to fill a position, but we&rsquo;re always
interested in hearing from good people. Please send CVs to info@lowrisc.org.</p>

<h4 id="are-contract-or-remote-working-arrangements-on-offer:4a1318da06786ac52626178ca960109e">Are contract or remote working arrangements on offer?</h4>

<p>We are not currently looking for contract or remote workers, but may in the
  future. If we do, we&rsquo;ll advertise via this website and the announcement
  list.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-the-goals-of-the-project:4a1318da06786ac52626178ca960109e">What are the goals of the project?</h4>

<ul>
<li>To create a fully open SoC and low-cost development board and to      support the open-source hardware community. This will involve volume      silicon manufacture.</li>
<li>To explore and promote novel hardware security features</li>
<li>To make it simple for existing companies and especially semiconductor      startups to create derivative designs, e.g. by sharing scripts, tools,      source and our experience</li>
<li>To create a benchmark design to aid academic research</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="when-can-i-buy-a-lowrisc-soc:4a1318da06786ac52626178ca960109e">When can I buy a lowRISC SoC?</h4>

<p>As with most tech projects, the most accurate answer is &ldquo;When it&rsquo;s ready&rdquo;.
  However, it&rsquo;s useful to consider some of the main milestones:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Release of an initial FPGA version:</em> we expect to do this in      the next 6 months, and then further development will be fully open to      the community.</li>
<li><em>Production of a test chip:</em> we expect to tape out a test chip towards the end      of 2015.</li>
<li><em>Tape out of production silicon:</em> this is likely to happen, at      the earliest, a year after the first test chip (in 2016).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="why-risc-v-and-not-openrisc-sparcv8-mips:4a1318da06786ac52626178ca960109e">Why RISC-V and not OpenRISC/SPARCv8/MIPS/&hellip;?</h4>

<p>We considered two aspects when surveying the potentially instruction set
  architectures (ISAs), firstly the features of the ISA itself and secondly
  the existence of high performance designs. RISC-V is a 64-bit,
  contemporary clean-sheet design. Implementations exist in an open-source
  HDL (Chisel) and multiple high performance test chips have been produced,
  at 45 and 28nm. When performing this survey, the requirement that the ISA
  be freely implementable rules out most ISAs currently used by the
  industry. We did consider using older versions of commercial ISAs (i.e.
  versions where all relevant patents would have expired), but this raises
  the issue of how to go about bringing them up to date. To avoid legal
  uncertainty, we would have to make arbitrarily different choices to the
  original vendor, which means compatibility would be lost.</p>

<h4 id="what-features-and-peripherals-will-the-soc-have:4a1318da06786ac52626178ca960109e">What features and peripherals will the SoC have?</h4>

<p>We&rsquo;ll distribute draft specifications as soon as is reasonable. The plan
  is to share as much as possible as early as possible.</p>

<h4 id="how-will-your-designs-be-licensed:4a1318da06786ac52626178ca960109e">How will your designs be licensed?</h4>

<p>A permissive open-source license.</p>

<h4 id="how-is-this-different-to-raspberry-pi:4a1318da06786ac52626178ca960109e">How is this different to Raspberry Pi?</h4>

<p>Our goals and focus are quite different. The Raspberry Pi exists to
  improve computer science education worldwide. A fully open-source SoC is
  not necessary to reach this goal, or even a pragmatic way of achieving it
  given the timescales involved. While it is an ultimate goal to support all
  the features of a modern commercial SoC, it will require a number of
  iterations of the design to achieve this. For example, early versions of
  our SoC will not include a GPU.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-your-relationship-to-raspberry-pi:4a1318da06786ac52626178ca960109e">What is your relationship to Raspberry Pi?</h4>

<p>We know the team well but this is a completely independent project.
  Robert co-founded Raspberry Pi, while Alex is a contributor since the very
  early days of the project.</p>

<h4 id="what-level-of-performance-will-it-have:4a1318da06786ac52626178ca960109e">What level of performance will it have?</h4>

<p>To run Linux &ldquo;well&rdquo;. The clock rate achieved will depend on the technology
  node and particular process selected. As a rough guide we would expect
  ~0.5-1GHz at 40nm and ~1.0-1.5GHz at 28nm.</p>

<h4 id="is-volume-fabrication-feasible:4a1318da06786ac52626178ca960109e">Is volume fabrication feasible?</h4>

<p>Yes. There are a number of routes open to us. Early production runs are
  likely to be done in batches of ~25 wafers. This would yield around
  100-200K good chips per batch. We expect to produce packaged chips for
  less than $10 each.</p>

<h4 id="how-can-i-contribute:4a1318da06786ac52626178ca960109e">How can I contribute?</h4>

<p>In the coming months we will be launching mailing lists, a Wiki and of
  course a source code repository to publicly coordinate development of the
  project. This will include both hardware and software work. We hope to
  have interesting, evidence-backed debates about implementation options out
  in the open.</p>
