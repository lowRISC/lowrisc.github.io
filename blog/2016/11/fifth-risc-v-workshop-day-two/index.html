<p>Today is the second day of the <a href="https://riscv.org/2016/10/5th-risc-v-workshop-agenda/">fifth RISC-V
workshop</a>. I&rsquo;ll be
keeping a semi-live blog of talks and announcements throughout the day.</p>

<h2 id="opensoc-system-architect-farzad-fatollahi-fard:529e3037a37627249629f6513082618e">OpenSoC System Architect: Farzad Fatollahi-Fard</h2>

<ul>
<li>Current architectures are wasteful. Only a small fraction of chip area goes
to computation.</li>
<li>For both GoblinCore and OpenHPC, ended up doing a lot of similar work to
achieve only a point design. Why not make a generator to avoid repeating the
same steps?</li>
<li>OpenSoC System Architect is a combination of multiple tools to form a
well-defined development flow for complex RISC-V SoCs</li>
<li>Supports standard RISC-V modules and custom extensions</li>
<li>It outputs pre-verified Chisel for the SoC, synthesisable Verilog, and an
LLVM compiler for the SoC</li>
<li>OpenSoC Fabric is an open-source, flexible, parameterised NoC generator. It
integrates with a wide variety of existing processors, as well as IO devices.</li>
<li>Created a &lsquo;CoreGen&rsquo; IR. It allows automatic generation of HDL
representations of the SoC and build LLVM compiler backend implementations of
the SoC and any extensions.</li>
<li>The IR is stored on disk in well-formed XML</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s next? Better support for Chisel3, more integration with existing
RISC-V tools and environment, frontend support to import existing
Chisel/Verilog/SystemVerilog. Also want CoreGen as a standalone IR</li>
<li>See the website at <a href="http://www.opensoc.community/">http://www.opensoc.community/</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="v-vector-extension-proposal-krste-asanovic:529e3037a37627249629f6513082618e">V Vector Extension Proposal: Krste Asanovic</h2>

<ul>
<li>The vector extension intends to scale to all reasonable design points
(low-cost microcontroller or high-performance supercomputer). Support both
implicit auto-vectorisation and explicit SPMD</li>
<li>Fit into the 32-bit encoding space, but be a base for future vector
extensions (e.g. crypto algorithms)</li>
<li>The goal is to ratify a proposal 12 months from now, at the 7th workshop</li>
<li>Cray-style vectors. &ldquo;The right way&rdquo; to exploit SIMD parallelism (as opposed
to the wrong way: GPUs or packed SIMD)</li>
<li>V has an implementation-dependent vector length, meaning the same code runs
across different hardware without recompiling</li>
<li>Each vector data register is configured with a width and type, or disabled.
There are also a configurable number of predicate registers. The maximum
vector length is a function of configuration, physical register storage, and
microarchitecture</li>
<li>There are a number of mandatory supported types. e.g. an RV32IF system must
support X8, X16, X32, F16, F32. This means that scalar and vector half
precision floating point is a requirement if you are supporting floating
point.</li>
<li>Each vector data register has a 4-bit field in a CSR (or multiple CSRs)
indicating its width, and another for its type.</li>
<li>A vcfgd CSR alias is defined to allow faster writes of common vector data
configurations.</li>
<li>Most user code would use the setvl instruction (which is actually setting a
CSR).</li>
<li>A 16-bit+32-bit vector addition is pleasingly straight forward to specify in
assembly</li>
<li>The architecture guarantees a minimum vector length of four regardless of
configuration. This means 1KB SRAM is required as a minimum</li>
<li>A polymorphic instruction encoding is used. A single signed integer ADD
opcode works on different size inputs and outputs, depending on the
configuration of its inputs.</li>
<li>There is support for vector atomics (e.g. vector fetch-and-add).</li>
<li>For vector function calls (e.g. in auto-vectorised code) you want to make
vector calls to a function library with separate vector calling convention.
The caller has to allocate registers for the callee to use. It sets the
maximum width, allowing the callee to change the vctype as needed.</li>
<li>For OpenCL/CUDA/SPMD, the configuration must be set at kernel launch to the
maximum width used anywhere in the call tree. It needs a general vector
function call capability with standard callee/caller save protocol</li>
<li>Krste argues autovectorisation is much preferable to OpenCL or CUDA.</li>
<li>Question: are you interested in smaller types (e.g. 4-bit). Answer: yes,
also interested in non-power-of-two types</li>
<li>Question about the calling convention: the vector configuration state is
assumed to be caller-saved (including the vector register file), meaning the
scalar ABI is unmodified</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="towards-thousand-core-risc-v-shared-memory-systems-quan-nguyen:529e3037a37627249629f6513082618e">Towards Thousand-Core RISC-V Shared Memory Systems: Quan Nguyen</h2>

<ul>
<li>Tardis is a new cache coherency protocol with greater scalability than
traditional directory coherence protocols.</li>
<li>Tardis enforces consistency through timestamps, using logical leases</li>
<li>It only tracks the exclusive owner of any particular cache line, requiring
only O(log N) storage. No broadcast invalidations, and timestamps aren&rsquo;t tied
to the core count. There is no need for synchronised real-time clocks</li>
<li>They are building a thousand-core prototype. Fit as many cores as possible
on a ZC706 FPGA, the connect in a 3D mesh to demonstrate at scale.</li>
<li>Want to adapt Tardis for release consistency (rather than sequential
consistency), and Quan introduces how they have started to do this by
introducing new timestamps</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Syntacore develops and licenses energy-efficient programmable cores
implementing the RISC-V ISA</li>
<li>SCRx is the family of RISC-V implementations, now available for evaluation.
Each core can be extended and customised</li>
<li>The smallest core, SCR1 is less than 20kgates in a basic untethered
configuration.</li>
<li>SCR3 is a high-performance MCU core with up to 1.7DMIPS/MHz,
3.16CoreMark/MHz.</li>
<li>SCR4 is an MCU core with a high-performance FPU.</li>
<li>SCR5 is an efficient mid-range embedded core. Full MMU with Linux support.
1GHz+ at 28nm, and 1.5+DMIPS/MHz per core.</li>
<li>In the near term, want to support the latest privileged spec, adding trace
debug</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ll try and write something up for the blog later, but for now see my
slides

</ul>

<h2 id="vm-threads-an-alternative-model-for-virtual-machines-on-risc-vm-ron-minnich:529e3037a37627249629f6513082618e">VM threads: an alternative model for virtual machines on RISC-VM: Ron Minnich</h2>

<ul>
<li>Akaros is a research kernel originally from UC Berkeley.</li>
<li>One core idea is the &lsquo;multi core process&rsquo;. This can be thought of as a set
of cores assigned an entity to a program.</li>
<li>How do VMs fit into the Akaros model. A VM could be kind of a process.</li>
<li>Look back at how we start a process. With the introduction of fork(), it
became easy and clean. But its introduction was controversial.</li>
<li>Virtualisation on Linux/BSD/Unix requires a device (e.g. /dev/kvm). This
typically requires daemons who are used to interact with the device. In
Akaros, they did not want to recreate this.</li>
<li>Can we just run a virtual machine like we do a thread? Introduce
<code>vthread_create</code>. In Akaros, they have extended the thread model to include
virtual machine threads.</li>
<li>Virtual machine threads (vthreads) can run Linux 4.8 (with 12 lines of
patches) and any code that shares the host ring 3 address space.</li>
<li>Ring 3 and Ring V share and address space. Ring V is limited to 2^46 bytes,
while ring 3 is in a 2^47 byte address space.</li>
<li>VM threads are integrated tightly into the kernel.</li>
<li>On x86, Akaros pairs page table roots and page table pages. Page table pages
are 2x4k pages, with the process PTP in the lower 4K and the VM PTP in the
upper 4K. This makes it trivial to convert the two.</li>
<li>It is significantly easier to write virtual machine managers in Akaros than
with the Linux model</li>
<li>Akaros VMS are unlike any other VMs - threads can easily switch from being a
VM to being a host thread</li>
<li>Kernels also look like threads, and spinning up a core looks like CPU
hotplug, accomplished by spinning up a vthread with IP at the 64-bit entry
point.</li>
<li>There are a variety of implications and questions for RISC-V. How will
RISC-V handle nested paging? Can we avoid massive shadow state. How about
injecting interrupts without a vmexit?</li>
<li>RISC-V is a chance to enable software innovation. We shouldn&rsquo;t get locked
into &ldquo;but we&rsquo;ve always done it this way&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Industrial/embedded UIs mostly look bad, but also have terribly user
experience</li>
<li>For better UIs you mostly have to jump to Android or Linux - there&rsquo;s a lack
of a middle ground</li>
<li>For a previous project, produced a mobile-like GUI experience targeting an
MCU (STM32F4).</li>
<li>With the right approach and tools, embedded GUIs can be beautiful too</li>
<li>Their library was written in C++, with support for layers+formats. It has
its own font engine for kerning, anti-aliasing etc.</li>
<li>The GUI is specified in XML and has its own minimal CSS</li>
<li>Initially developed for eCos RTOS, and has an initial port for FreeRTOS. Can
also run on Linux.</li>
<li>To prototype on a Zynq, implemented &lsquo;micro blender&rsquo; for blending, filling,
scaling etc. This was written in Chisel.</li>
<li>Software-driven IP (silicon) is possible (and advisable!)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="a-fast-instruction-set-simulator-for-risc-v-maxim-maslov:529e3037a37627249629f6513082618e">A Fast Instruction Set Simulator for RISC-V: Maxim Maslov</h2>

<ul>
<li>Esperanto is a stealth mode startup designing chips with RISC-V</li>
<li>Wanted a fast RISC-V ISA simulator capable of running large applications
with minimal slowdown</li>
<li>[Sorry folks, I had to duck out for a quick discussion - see the
<a href="https://riscv.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wed1330-Fast-ISA-Simulator-for-RISC-V-Maslov-Esperanto.pdf">slides</a>]</li>

<h2 id="go-on-rv64g-benjamin-barenblat-and-michael-pratt:529e3037a37627249629f6513082618e">Go on RV64G: Benjamin Barenblat and Michael Pratt</h2>

<ul>
<li>Why RISC-V? Better architecture, lower power, faster processing, easier
accelerator development. RISC-V is not going away</li>
<li>The Go toolchain is complex. It has its own compiler, assembler (and
assembly language), and linker</li>
<li>Getting close, but the runtime doesn&rsquo;t quite compile. Hope to get it working
in the next few months.</li>
<li>In the mean time, relatively simple go programs will compile and run</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s been mostly good. One pain-point has been that other Go ports don&rsquo;t
target architectures with good conditional branches so had to emulate a flag
register. Another gripe is that loading 64-bit constants is a pain.</li>
<li>Within a couple of months you should be able to compile real Go programs and
have them run on RISC-V</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="a-java-virtual-machine-for-risc-v-porting-the-jikes-rvm-martin-maas:529e3037a37627249629f6513082618e">A Java Virtual Machine for RISC-V: Porting the Jikes RVM: Martin Maas</h2>

<ul>
<li>Why do a JVM port? Both to run interesting applications, and for research
(e.g. hardware support for GCed languages)</li>
<li>Porting OpenJDK/Hotspot for high performance, and the Jikes research VM for
academic work. This talk will focus on Jikes</li>
<li>Jikes is itself written in Java</li>
<li>JVMs have a large number of dependencies, so use the riscv-poky Linux
distribution generator to build a cross-compiled SDK and Linux image.</li>
<li>While developing, add assertions everywhere to fail as early as possible</li>
<li>Allowed the JIT to selectively emit instructions that dump trace output</li>
<li>Booting JikesRVM is no easy task (there a <em>lot</em> to do in order to get to
hello world)</li>
<li>The non-optimising JIT compiler is mostly feature-complete. Passes <sup>65</sup>&frasl;<sub>68</sub>
core tests. Targets RV64G</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>&lsquo;Open source&rsquo; hardware. Raspberry Pi have sold 10 million boards, Arduino
sold 4.5 million boards (estimated). Some predictions indicate the market will
be worth over $1B within the next four years. These are based on commercial,
closed-source silicon</li>
<li>OnChip UIS have developed an open 32-bit RISC-V based microcontroller. To
test the initial silicon, used chip-on-board</li>
<li>RV32IM with a 3-stage pipeline. On TSMC 130nm GP. Die area 2.1mm x 2.1mm.</li>
<li>The Microprocessor core is 0.12mm2, max freq 200MHz, core voltage 1.2V, core
dynamic power at 100MHz is 167uW/MHz (all peripheral clocks disabled)</li>
<li>Arduino is mostly aimed at children in secondary schools.</li>
