today in Barcleona. As usual, I&rsquo;ll be keeping a semi-live blog of talks and
announcements throughout the day.</p>

<p>Look back <a href="http://www.lowrisc.org/blog/2018/05/barcelona-risc-v-workshop-day-one">here</a> for
the day one live blog.</p>

<p>Note that slides from most presentations are now <a href="https://riscv.org/2018/05/risc-v-workshop-in-barcelona-proceedings/">available at

<h2 id="fast-interrupts-for-risc-v-krste-asanovic:a5d6ec65113439624abf306f86726737">Fast interrupts for RISC-V: Krste Asanovic</h2>

<ul>
<li>Embedded is a major use for RISC-V. There is a desire for faster interrupt
handling with support for nested preempted interrupts.</li>
<li>Summary of current RISC-V interrupts

<ul>
<li>Local interrupts are directly connected to one hart. There&rsquo;s no
arbitration between harts to service. Determine cause through xcause CSR.
Only two standard local interrupts (software, timer).</li>
<li>Global (external) interrupts are routed via the platform-level interrupt
controller (PLIC) which arbitrates between multiple harts claiming an
interrupt.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The machine interrupt pending (mip) CSR contains bits for local software,
local timer, and external interrupts (from the PLIC). It tells you which
interrupts are present.</li>
<li>mie mirrors the layout of mip, and allows you to enable/disable interrupts.</li>
<li>mstatus keeps track of interrupt status, containing a small interrupt stack.</li>
<li>The interrupt is reported in the mcause CSR. The exception code indicates
which interrupt was responsible - you might have to then interrogate the PLIC
if it was an external interrupt.</li>
<li>mtvec (machine trap vector base) contains the address of the trap vector
(&lsquo;base&rsquo;). It also contains bits which control whether interrupts are direct
(all exceptions and interrupts jump to base) or vectored (exceptions go to
base, interrupts are vectored).</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s two parts of an interrupt: what you were doing when it happened
(state context), and what you&rsquo;re going to do. mepc and mstatus allow the
contact to be saved and restored.</li>
<li>Problems with current interrupts:

<ul>
<li>Hardware preemption is only possible by switching privileged modes</li>
<li>Fixed priority for local interrupts</li>
<li>The vector table holds jumps instructions, which can only jump +/- 1MiB. A
free register would be required to jump further, resulting in even more
instructions.</li>
<li>PLIC has variable priority, but the vectoring must be done in software.</li>
<li>The PLIC needs two memory accesses: one to claim it, one to indicate
completion.</li>
<li>The Unix ABI (which is the only one that has been standardised) requires
many registers to be saved/restored.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Have had input via multiple proposals: Andes, Syntacore, Seagate, Liviu
Ionescu, SiFive</li>
<li>There have been discussions on the list about the interrupt handler
interface for software. It comes down to a choice between having the interrupt
handler as a regular C function (requiring save/restore of all caller-save
registers in hardware or software) or an inline handler which uses a gcc
interrupt attribute to convert the function to always callee-save every
register. Krste suggests both approaches are needed.</li>
<li>Krste explains how an &ldquo;interrupt&rdquo; attribute on a C function might work. In
this example, every register is callee-saved, so registers are saved as you
need to use them.</li>
<li>If you then went to call a function using the C ABI you need to save/restore
8 arguments, 7 temporaries, and 1 return address. Even more if you have to
save the floating point context. Krste argues that moving this to hardware
isn&rsquo;t enough, you need a new ABI to reduce the amount of state.</li>
<li>A number of options have been proposed for vectoring.

<ul>
<li>Having function pointers in a table. Downside is this is new functionality
you&rsquo;d have to add to a pipeline.</li>
<li>The SiFive proposal is to add a new +/-2GiB offset instruction which is
only visible in a new interrupt ISA mode. The advantage is the pipeline can
treat this as a regular instruction fetch, albeit with a different encoding.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Would like to allow each interrupt to be configured with its privilege mode
and the &lsquo;interrupt level&rsquo; which describes the preemption level, and a
priority.</li>
<li>To manage preempted context state it&rsquo;s necessary to push/pop
mepc/mpp/mil/mie to a memory stack. You also need to remember the previous
interrupt level, &lsquo;mil&rsquo;. Now multiple levels must be tracked, which Krste
proposes could be stored in mcause.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="risc-v-dsp-p-extension-proposal-chuan-hua-chang:a5d6ec65113439624abf306f86726737">RISC-V DSP (P) extension proposal: Chuan-Hua Chang</h2>

<ul>
<li>P extension task group will define and ratify a packed-SIMD DSP extension
containing instructions which operate on XLEN-bit integer registers. It will
also define compiler intrinsic functions that can be directly used in
high-level programming languages.</li>
<li>The initial proposal is based on the AndeStar V3 DSP ISA.</li>
<li>Supports e.g. 16-bit SIMD instructions with min, max, abs, compare, clip
operations. Similar for 8-bit SIMD.</li>
<li>GPR-based SIMD is more efficient for various embedded domains. It addresses
the need for high performance generic code processing as well as digital
signal processing.</li>
<li>Want to make this easy to use through intrinsic functions and optimised DSP
libraries.</li>
<li>For 64-bit data types, use pairs of GPRs on RV32. An implementation could of
course still use a 2R1W register file, but use multiple cycles to read a
64-bit value.</li>
<li>After the task group is created, bi-weekly meetings will be set up.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="security-task-group-update-richard-newell:a5d6ec65113439624abf306f86726737">Security task group update: Richard Newell</h2>

<ul>
<li>The security group was previously a task group of the technical committee.
There is now a new security standing committee, at the same level with the
marketing and technical committees.</li>
<li>Task groups will be set up to look at cryptograpshic ISA extensions and
trusted execution environments for microcontroller</li>
<li>The full charter will be published on riscv.org</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="formal-assurance-for-risc-v-implementations-daniel-m-zimmerman:a5d6ec65113439624abf306f86726737">Formal assurance for RISC-V implementations: Daniel M. Zimmerman</h2>

<ul>
<li>Galois started with a focus on cryptography, but has broadened its scope to
&ldquo;high assurance everything&rdquo;</li>
<li>There are a range of definitions for RISC-V. The human-readable instruction
manual, mechanisations in the form of software simulators or hardware
implementations. The formal model working group have also been working on
this.</li>
<li>How can we provide assurance about these definitions / mechanisations?</li>
<li>Assurance means: the system does what it is supposed to do and doesn&rsquo;t do
anything else.</li>
<li>When trying to get assurance through compliance tests, a huge burden is put
on the shoulders of the test writers. Those conformance tests need to be 100%
complete. This also doesn&rsquo;t help determine if an implementation has
undesirable behaviours.</li>
<li>Alternatively, formally verify your system. Compile a model to RTL via
clash, then use equivalence checking tools to compare against your own
implementation.</li>
<li>Need machine-readable specification of the correctness and security of an
implementation as well as a way to measure the conformance of an
implementation.</li>
<li>How to validate a specification?

<ul>
<li>Might perform rigorous validation through execution: ad hoc testing,
simulation coverage analysis, or bisimulation.</li>
<li>Alternatively perform rigorous verification through formal reasoning:
prove test benches always pass, verification coverage analysis, or
bisimulation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Security properties require a different approach. They typically have a
different form, e.g. &ldquo;the following property must never hold&rdquo;. Galois is
developing a DSL that lets you specify the architecture, correctness
properties and security properties of a hardware design. It&rsquo;s also working on
a security test suite.</li>
<li>Want to help systems engineers understand and explore the effects of design
and implementation decisions on power, performance, area, and security.</li>
<li>Status

<ul>
<li>LANDO DSL is in early stages of development. Expect initial version before
2018 RISC-V summit</li>
<li>Security test suite: early stages of development</li>
<li>Metrics and measures: evaluating existing tools for PPA and looking at
existing metrics work for security</li>
<li>Dashboard: early stages of design</li>
<li>Feature model generation: early stages of design</li>
</ul></li>

<h2 id="undefined-unspecified-non-deterministic-and-implementation-defined-behavior-in-verifiable-specifications-clifford-wolf:a5d6ec65113439624abf306f86726737">Undefined, Unspecified, Non-deterministic, and Implementation Defined Behavior in Verifiable Specifications: Clifford Wolf</h2>

<ul>
<li>Users of an ISA specification

<ul>
<li>Software engineers: just don&rsquo;t do anything that&rsquo;s not specified</li>
<li>Software security engineers: what can we expect from the hardware if we do
the thing that wasn&rsquo;t specified?</li>
<li>Hardware design engineers: do something safe and simple for anything not
specified. But what does safe mean?</li>
<li>Hardware verification engineers</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This presentation is a taxonomy of types of &lsquo;not specified&rsquo; behaviour, using
nomenclature taking from different domains.</li>
<li>Undefined behaviour: the &ldquo;just don&rsquo;t do that&rdquo; approach to not specifying
behaviour. The spec is void for any program as a whole if it does this
undefined behaviour once.</li>
<li>Could introduce an &lsquo;undefined value&rsquo;, but that has similar issues</li>
<li>Non-deterministic behaviour / unpredictable behaviour: allow more than one
choice, which may change under re-execution</li>
<li>Unspecified value: the instruction will return a value, but the spec doesn&rsquo;t
say which value</li>
<li>Implementation defined behaviour / value: similar to unspecified value /
behaviour, but the implementer must specify what it is.</li>
<li>Fully specified behaviour: the ideal choice for verification. Explicitly
state what all implementations must do.</li>
<li>Clifford strongly prefers implementation defined or fully specified
behaviour.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Architecture 1.0 (see Mark Hill paper). The world was very
processor-centric. CPUs with memory attached.</li>
<li>Architecture 2.0. Not just the ISA. Move towards memory-driven computing.

<ul>
<li>Numerical processing is trivial, but achieving efficient memory access is
very hard.</li>
<li>Caches now need to be protected machine state.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>An RV128 working group is going to be started, chaired by Steven

<ul>
<li>Propose a 64-bit object ID and 64-bit byte offset.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>On an RV128 system, have to be able to execute RV64 programs and map 64-bit
virtual into 128-bit virtual. Also map system calls.</li>
<li>Object 0 is kernel object, object 1 RV64, object 2 RV32.</li>
<li>Encrypted memory is identified with an object ID</li>
<li>Steven suggests disabling speculation if kernel objects are referenced.</li>

<h2 id="securing-high-performance-risc-v-processors-from-time-speculation-chris-celio:a5d6ec65113439624abf306f86726737">Securing High-performance RISC-V Processors from Time Speculation: Chris Celio</h2>

<ul>
<li>Meltdown and Spectre don&rsquo;t just impact a single processor design or a single
company&rsquo;s design, but really impact any CPU using speculation.</li>
<li>A timing attack is when a change in your program input affects the time of
another user.</li>
<li>There are 3 parts to a timing attack

<ul>
<li>Victim runs code that leaks observable side effects</li>
<li>Attacker runs code affected by timing leaks</li>
<li>Attacker measures time his code took to run</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Chris built up a taxonomy of time leaks. Two axes: were are we leaking from,
and what are we directly leaking.</li>
<li>High level ideas:

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t leak any observable side-effects in the machine if speculation is
aborted</li>
<li>Avoid bandwidth interference between different time domains. Depending on
the time domain you care about, this could be bandwidth to a functional
unit.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Modern speculative cores have 100-300 instructions in-flight, but not all
are speculative. About 25% are beyond the point of non-return.</li>
<li>Idea: do not update predictors speculatively.</li>
<li>Idea: Don&rsquo;t speculatively update the cache. Could get rid of fully inclusive
L1/L2/L3 caches in favour of neither exclusive nor inclusive (NENI) caches.
Then allocate only into the L1 cache.</li>
<li>Idea: misspeculation recovery should be deterministic. Any shared resource
can leak time</li>
<li>Idea: partition caches etc</li>
<li>Idea: dynamic partitioning</li>
<li>Idea: partial and full flushes. e.g. flush <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> BTB entries.</li>
<li>Many other ideas (see the full list in the slides!)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="evaluation-of-risc-v-for-pixel-visual-core-matt-cockrell:a5d6ec65113439624abf306f86726737">Evaluation of RISC-V for Pixel Visual Core: Matt Cockrell</h2>

<ul>
<li>Background: the Pixel Visual Core is a Google-design Image Processing Unit
(IPU). It has a dedicated A53 which aggregates application layer IPU resource
requests.</li>
<li>Looking at adding a microcontroller as a job scheduling and dispatch unit.</li>
<li>When selecting a core, key considerations were: level of effort (how
difficult to integrate), risk (stability and reliability of support), and
license.</li>
<li>First candidate was the internal &lsquo;Bottle Rocket&rsquo; project. This implements
RV32IMC, reusing parts of the Rocket design. High level of effort, medium
risk.</li>
<li>Second candidate: Merlin (github.com/origintfj/riscv). Low level of effort,
high risk.</li>
<li>Third candidate: RI5CY, produced by the PULP team. Low level of effort,
medium risk.</li>
<li>Selected RI5CY for a number of reasons: it had been taped out, had good
infrastructure, the license was acceptable, and it was implemented in
SystemVerilog rather than Chisel.</li>
<li>Why SystemVerilog rather than Chisel?

<ul>
<li>SystemVerilog builds on established physical design and verification flows</li>
<li>Chisel generated verilog loses designer&rsquo;s intent, making it difficult to
read and debug</li>
<li>Chisel generated code makes certain physical design items difficult such
as sync/asnc clocks, power domains, clock domains etc</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Next steps: add full compliance for privilege/debug specification and
evaluate performance impact after adding RI5CY to the Pixel Visual Core.</li>
</ul>

</ul></li>
<li>Delivered 32-bit and 64-bit implementations of the V5 architecture
implementation AndeStar V5m which is a superset of RV-IMAC.</li>
<li>An N25 (32-bit) small configuration is 37k gates at 28HPC, 1GHz. Large

<ul>
<li>Understanding program behaviour in complex system isn&rsquo;t easy, and using a
debugger isn&rsquo;t always possible. Processor Branch Trace can provide visibility
into program execution.</li>
<li>Processor Branch Trace works by tracking execution from a known start
address and sending messages about the deltas taking by the program. For
uncoditional branches, there is no need to report the destination address.</li>
<li>The trace encoder ingress port defines singles to export from the processor.
It contains information such as the privilege mode, address of the
instruction, the instruction.</li>
<li>The trace encoer sends a packet which could contain a delta update with a
subset of information, or a full context to force synchronisation.</li>
<li>Trace control can control when a trace is generated, or configure filters.</li>
<li>Saw a mean 0.252 bits/instruction encoding efficiency across a range of
benchmarks.</li>
<li>Next steps: set up task group to standardise processor to encoder interface
and a compressed branch trace format</li>

<li>M, S, U privilege modes. TLB. Tightly integrated D$ and I$, hardware page
table walker</li>
<li>Area around 185kGE</li>
<li>Greater than 1.5GHz at 22FDX</li>
<li>Critical path is 25 logic levels</li>
<li>6 stage pipeline. In-order issue, out-of-order writeback, in-order commit</li>
<li>Why develop another core?

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t want an SoC generator. Don&rsquo;t want to be governed by a 3rd party</li>
</ul></li>
<li>First implementation took about 4 months</li>
<li>Designed for higher performance in the future: dual issue and/or OoO issue</li>
<li>Verification strategy

<ul>
<li>RISC-V tests</li>
<li>Torture test framework</li>
<li>Running applications on FPGA e.g. bootling Linux</li>
<li>Verification isn&rsquo;t exhaustive, looking into more alternatives</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ariane was open-sourced in February 2018. Already seen non-trivial external
contributions.</li>
<li>Latest improvements:

<ul>
<li>Completely revised instruction frontend.</li>
<li>Re-naming in issue stage</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Return address stack cost ~1KGE, improves IPC by 20%. Resolving
unconditional jumps immediately increases IPC by ~11%. These changes had no
negative impact on timing.</li>
<li>Critical paths are on the memory interfaces, especially tag compare and
address translation for cache access.</li>
<li>Kerbin is a proof of concept SoC for Ariane featuring PULP peripherals, a
64-bit interconnect and debug support.</li>
<li>Compatible with gdb, but require a debug bridge currently.</li>
<li>Managed to boot Linux after 5 months development</li>
<li>FPGA: Targeted the VC707. Core runs at 50-100MHz, 15kLUTs.</li>
<li>Ariane has been taped out in GF22FDX. 910MHz, &hellip;</li>
<li>Working on Kosmodrom tapeout which includes a high performance and a low
power version and a floating point accelerator.</li>
<li>Working on supporting F and D extensions as well as reduced prevision vector
operations. Stand-alone floating point unit (~200kGE) will be released in the
next months.</li>
<li>Also working on improved integer divider, vector unit, and hardware support
for atomic memory operations</li>
<li>Help wanted: support for official RISC-V debug, improved branch predictors,
multithreading, cache-coherent interconnect, &hellip;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>(Missed the first few minutes I&rsquo;m afraid)</li>
<li>RISC-V changes: introduce new instructions. ucst (uncacheable write to
memory), ucld (uncacheable read from memory)</li>
<li>Also modify the cache controller and memory controller</li>
<li>These changes would enable new applications. Even defining the instructions
would allow people to start work using software simulation tools.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Sparse data sets that greatly exceed a processor&rsquo;s cache size are a
challenge for most systems. The cache hit rate is low resulting in idle cores.</li>
<li>The Hybrid Threading Processor defines extensions for thread and message
management. It&rsquo;s a high thread count barrel processor similar to Cray&rsquo;s MTA
architecture.

<ul>
<li>Software-managed coherency</li>
<li>Event driven processor.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Can perform atomic operations at memory due to the software-managed
coherency</li>
<li>The project was funded under the DARPA CHIPS project. This produced two
chiplets: the memory controller (MC) chiplet and compute near memory (CNM)
chiplet.</li>
<li>Implemented a simulator modelling functionality and performance, and also
performed power estimation.</li>
<li>Performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the optimal configuration.</li>
<li>Compared performance for graph spectral clustering vs Haswell, Nvidia K80,
Nvidia DGX-1. Saw ~25x better energy efficiency.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Security of the system is not limited to just &ldquo;one part&rdquo;. You need to
consider the entire system</li>
<li>An open approach has proven useful for security in software. Why should
hardware be any different?</li>
<li>Cryptographic accelerators can easily achieve high throughput with low area.</li>
<li>PULP provides multiple opportunities to add extensions. e.g. new
instructions added directly to the core, adding peripherals to the bus, or
hardware accelerators with direct memory access</li>
<li>Implemented Fulmine, an IoT processor with accelerators. Added two TCDM
ports, 64bits/cycle. The AES unit performs 2 rounds a cycle, 1.76Gbit/s and
120pJ per byte (entire chip) at 0.8V and 84MHz</li>
<li>Side channel attacks are a huge challenge. Recently implemented a leakage
resilient accelerator which reduces the attack surface by generating a new key
per data block. This provides 5.29Gbit/s throughput at 256Mhz</li>
<li>Attacks that target control flow are a serious problem and can be realized
in both hardware (e.g. glitching) or software. Implemented and published
sponge based control-flow protection (SCFP), which stores instructions
encrypted in memory. As instructions must be decrypted, the attacker would
have to modify both the instruction and the internal state.

<ul>
<li>Implemented in Patronus chip. 25-35% power/area overhead, and 10$ runtime
overhead due to &lsquo;patches&rsquo; and additional commands.</li>
<li>The probability of an illegal instruction trap when an instruction altered
is 91.51% within 1 cycle rising to 99.95% within 3 cycles.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>New markets have new software requirements</li>
<li>Virtual platforms can help accelerate software development</li>
<li>Imperas produce extendable platform kits (EPKs). These are virtual platforms
with software set-up, allowing users to start quickly.</li>
<li>Offer the ability to easily define custom instruction extensions</li>
<li>Can also perform software development using the Ashling RISC-V IDE</li>
