Introduction</h2><p>Beginning on Monday, 27th June 2016, a team of 4 undergraduate students from
the University of Cambridge joined the <a href=https://www.lowrisc.org/>lowRISC</a>
project for a 10 week internship, kindly sponsored by <a href=http://www.imc.nl>IMC Financial
Markets</a>. The purpose of this report is to provide a
technical description of the work undertaken and the devices produced. This
will allow others to understand and continue with the work in the future, or
to contribute to the lowRISC chip in a similar fashion. For information on how
to use the accelerators and infrastructure produced during the internship,
without the technical description, please see the appropriate tutorial. All
development was done using the <a href=http://store.digilentinc.com/nexys-4-ddr-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-ece-curriculum/>Digilent Nexys 4
DDR</a>
board, which uses a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA. All source code can be found on
<a href=https://github.com/nbdd0121/lowrisc-chip>github</a>.</p><hr><h2 id=2-license:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>2. License</h2><p><a href=https://github.com/lowRISC/lowrisc-chip/blob/master/LICENSE>License</a></p><hr><h2 id=3-overview-of-the-project:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>3. Overview of the Project</h2><p>The objective of our internship was to take the current lowRISC System-on-Chip
design and demonstrate how an interested individual or team could extend it
and add an accelerator of their own. After some initial discussion, we decided
to aim to extend the current lowRISC SoC design to enable video output, with
the final goal of playing video smoothly at a resolution of 640x480 on our
Nexys 4 DDR FPGAs.</p><p>This task was decomposed into several milestones: adding VGA functionality to
lowRISC, adding an in-memory framebuffer, implementing a video codec for
RISC-V, and designing and creating 2D accelerators to allow real-time video
decoding, with the majority of the work being in the development of the
accelerators. The planned architecture for the augmented SoC is shown in the
the diagram below, with the new elements being the Video Accelerator and the
Video controller. Communication is performed over the AXI protocol. The
implementation of AXI we used was called NASTI (&lsquo;Not A STandard
Interface&rsquo;) by its authors. All future references to AXI use the NASTI name.</p><p><img src=../augmented_arch.png style=width:600px></p><p>In order to fully satisfy the goal of demonstrating how others might use the
lowRISC SoC, in addition to developing our accelerators it was necessary to
produce full documentation so our work could be reproduced. To achieve this,
we decided we would produce a number of tutorials explaining how to use the
infrastructure and devices we created, and a technical report (this document)
describing the details of the devices produced.</p><hr><h2 id=4-approaching-the-task:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>4. Approaching the Task</h2><h3 id=4-1-codec-discussion:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>4.1 Codec Discussion</h3><p>We quickly decided we&rsquo;d follow an existing video codec standard and either
implement it ourselves or fork an existing free implementation. A myriad of
possibilities are available due to the wide range of existing video formats.
The limitations of the FPGAs we were working with narrowed the selection
considerably as options such as H.265 were just too computationally taxing to
work with. We ended up with a shortlist of three: VP8 (WebM), MPEG-2 (H.262)
and MPEG-4 AVC (H.264). Ultimately, we decided on MPEG-2 because of a readily
available reference implementation (under a BSD-like license) and its
relatively low computational complexity compared to the other options.</p><h3 id=4-2-specific-objectives:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>4.2 Specific Objectives</h3><p>These were the formal objectives we defined, against which we could evaluate the progress and success of the project:</p><ul><li>Extending lowRISC to decode MPEG-2 encoded video at a resolution of 640x480, and playing at a rate of 8 frames-per-second on our FPGAs*</li><li>Tutorials describing<ul><li>Using the video output controller</li><li>Extending lowRISC with new devices</li><li>Adding additional accelerators using our infrastructure</li></ul></li><li>Technical descriptions of<ul><li>The accelerator infrastructure</li><li>The DCT/IDCT hardware device, including the control logic</li><li>The chroma conversion accelerators</li></ul></li></ul><p>*The platform these technical objectives were to be achieved on is the
<a href=http://store.digilentinc.com/nexys-4-ddr-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-ece-curriculum/>Digilent Nexys 4
DDR</a>
board, running the lowRISC chip design. The board provides 63,400 LUTs, 4,860
Kbits of block RAM, and 128 MiB DDR2. The existing lowRISC chip architecture
consumes 50,859 logic cells, and provides a 64-bit RISC-V core running at
25MHz.</p><h3 id=4-3-previous-work:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>4.3 Previous Work</h3><h4 id=4-3-1-lowrisc:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>4.3.1 lowRISC</h4><p>Started in early 2015, lowRISC is a not-for-profit organisation working
closely with the University of Cambridge and the open-source community.
lowRISC is creating a fully open-source, Linux-capable, RISC-V-based System on
Chip with the goal of producing a low-cost development board - supporting the
open-source hardware community. Other goals are to explore and promote novel
security features, to make it simple for companies to make derivative designs,
and to create a benchmark design to aid academic research.</p><h4 id=4-3-2-mpeg-2-codec:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>4.3.2 MPEG-2 codec</h4><p>The MPEG-2 codec was defined to resolve the shortcomings on the MPEG-1 codec,
and was standardised in 2000. As such many implementations have been produced.
Our starting point for getting video running on lowRISC was the reference
implementation distributed at
<a href=http://www.mpeg.org/MPEG/video/mssg-free-mpeg-software.html>mpeg.org</a> (note:
part way through the internship the mpeg.org website went down. An archive of
the page can be found
<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604180636/http://www.mpeg.org/MPEG/video/mssg-free-mpeg-software.html>here</a>).
Over the course of the internship we found that this implementation provided a
number of features which we did not need and only served to reduce overall
performance. We also found that it had not been written with performance in
mind, and was not easy to optimise. However by this point our work was tightly
coupled with the library, and so it was not feasible to switch to a different
implementation. On reflection it would have been wise to schedule more time
for software rewriting, or to start from a more modern reference.</p><hr><h2 id=5-outputting-to-vga:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>5. Outputting to VGA</h2><h3 id=5-1-implementing-vga-specification:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>5.1 Implementing VGA Specification</h3><p>VGA output is controlled by a pair of signals, <code>HSync</code> (horizontal
synchronisation) and <code>VSync</code> (vertical synchronisation) . The timing of these
two signals is used by the monitor to calculate the clock frequency of each
transmitted pixel. The video controller we developed generates <code>R</code>, <code>G</code>, <code>B</code>,
<code>HSync</code> and <code>VSync</code> signals which can be connected to a digital-to-analog
converter (DAC) for VGA output. The colour channels support 8-bit colour per
channel, meaning 24-bit true colour is supported. However, since the DAC on
the Nexys4 DDR board we used is 4-bit only, we are simply ignoring half of the
output pins. A diagram of the VGA ports used is shown here.</p><p><img src=../vga_port.png></p><h3 id=5-2-video-controller:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>5.2 Video Controller</h3><p>The video controller acts as an I/O slave device by mapping control registers
to I/O space; it also acts as a DMA master device fetching frames repeatedly
from memory. Currently the video controller is running at a rate of 125MHz,
meaning a maximum of 960p video output is supported.</p><h4 id=5-2-1-control-registers:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>5.2.1 Control Registers</h4><p>The video controller exposes an AXI-lite interface for communication with the
rocket core. The address space of memory mapped control registers is 4096
Bytes, and each register is 32-bits. Therefore we have access to 1024 possible
registers. Currently only 18 of them are used.</p><h4 id=5-2-2-driver:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>5.2.2 Driver</h4><p>To interact with the video driver in bare metal, you need to manipulate the
above registers by yourself. A helper header <em>video.h</em> is provided with macro
defined.</p><p>In Linux, a driver is provided to register the video controller as a
framebuffer, so you can use standard framebuffer operation to deal with this
device.</p><hr><h2 id=6-mpeg-2-decode-implementation:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>6. MPEG-2 Decode Implementation</h2><p>As mentioned in section 4.3, we used the MPEG-2 implementation distributed on
<a href=http://www.mpeg.org/MPEG/video/mssg-free-mpeg-software.html>mpeg.org</a> as the
starting point for decoding video on the lowRISC chip. The reference
implementation provided functionality for outputting each frame to a number of
formats, including Y&rsquo;UV frames, SIF, PPM, and others. With this we then began
modifying the library to allow outputting to the frame-buffer described in the
previous section, rather than a file. Since the frame-buffer required raw RGB
values, the basis of our function was the PPM output function.</p><h3 id=6-1-profiling:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>6.1 Profiling</h3><p>To identify useful opportunities for acceleration, we performed profiling of
the reference implementation using <a href=https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/gprof/>GNU
gprof</a>, a performance analysis
tool for Unix applications. The data was gathered on an Intel i5 processor,
and so while not being exactly representative of how the codec would run on
the FPGA-based lowRISC configuration we&rsquo;re targeting, it allowed us an insight
into the high-level function calls of the program.</p><p><img src=../profile.png style=width:700px></p><p>This diagram represents the call graph of the program, and is colour coded
according to the percentage of time spent within each function. A number of
candidates for acceleration can be identified, such as form predictions, IDCT
operations, and chroma conversions. The chroma conversions, labelled on the
diagram as conv420to422, conv422to444, and convYuvToRgb, especially present an
excellent candidate for acceleration since they are well-defined operations
which are guaranteed to be at the end of a video compression pipeline</p><p>We also performed some cache analysis using
<a href=http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/cg-manual.html>Cachegrind</a>, part of the
<a href=http://valgrind.org/info/tools.html>Valgrind tool suite</a>. Again, this was
run on x86 machines, so it only provided an approximation of performance on
lowRISC. The results gave some context to the output from the profiling, for
example telling us that the display branch of the above tree does most of the
memory I/O in the program and that conv422to444 has a poor cache hit rate
which explains why it takes longer than the surrounding calls.</p><hr><h2 id=7-infrastructure-for-accelerators:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>7. Infrastructure for Accelerators</h2><p>In this section, we will cover the infrastructure of our General Purpose
Stream Pipelined Accelerator (SPA).</p><h3 id=7-1-concept:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>7.1 Concept</h3><p>Over the course of development the design has evolved. We started with a much
more specialised video accelerator, but have ultimately arrived at a more
purpose accelerator infrastructure supporting all kinds of AXI4-Stream
compatible processors.</p><p>The fundamental idea behind this accelerator idea is streams. In our case,
most data can be processed independently, so can be abstracted as separate
streams streams. For streams, we can make use of pipelining the reduce number
of clock cycles needed to process data. All accelerators in this
infrastructure have a pair of AXI4-Stream interface as their only I/O. Data
is piped into the accelerator by AXI4-Stream slave port on the accelerator,
and piped out from AXI4-Stream master port. Our infrastructure has no direct
communication with the accelerators, but uses packet concept in AXI4-Stream as
the boundary between data. The infrastructure is only responsible for packet
routing and data moving.</p><h3 id=7-2-architecture:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>7.2 Architecture</h3><p><img src=../accelerator_arch.png style=width:500px></p><p>This is the third iteration of the architecture design.</p><p>Originally we were planning to use DMA to move data into local BRAM, and then
processing on BRAM. This design was quickly abandoned due to poor
extensibility. It also introduced lots of duplicate control logic but they are
so tightly coupled that we could not modularize it easily.</p><p>The idea of stream came into play at this stage, inspired by Java&rsquo;s Stream IO.
Most data to be accelerated has good locality, meaning that it does not depend
on data further away. In this case, it is natural to abstract them into
continuous byte packets. There is still a control unit in this iteration,
responsible for receiving instructions, interpret them, and send them to data
movers.</p><p>In the current architecture, the control unit is removed, and we are sending
commands to data movers directly. The data mover will set <code>T_DEST</code>
accordingly, and the crossbar will be responsible for data forwarding. By
adapting this design, stream processors can be piped to another, as long as
<code>T_DEST</code> is correctly set. We also benefit from standardized interface by
embracing AXI4-Stream specification.</p><h3 id=7-3-scatter-gather:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>7.3 Scatter-Gather</h3><p>During development, we&rsquo;ve found that we need scatter-gather support to speed
things up. Due to existence of the MMU, we can only guarantee physical address
continuity within the page, which obviously limits the use case of our
accelerator. We address this issue by adding scatter-gather support to the
data movers, and use a last bit in the every data move command to identify if
this command is the last one in the packet.</p><h3 id=7-4-accelerator-instruction:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>7.4 Accelerator Instruction</h3><p>The accelerator has two FIFOs: input command FIFO and output command FIFO. The
first one controls the data mover moving data into the accelerator and the
other one controls the opposite direction. Routing will take place
automatically by internal crossbar.</p><table><thead><tr><th>63-56</th><th>55</th><th>54-40</th><th>39</th><th>38-6</th><th>5-3</th><th>2-0</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Attributes</td><td>Last</td><td>Length</td><td>Reserved</td><td>Address</td><td>Reserved</td><td>Opcode</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The length field is 15-bit long, this contains 6th to 20th bit of the actual
length, with lower 6-bits padded with 0. Address field is the same, it
contains 6th to 38th bit of actual length with lower 6-bit padded with 0. This
design supports 39-bit physical address, which is the same as what lowRISC
current supports.</p><p>Data movers in both direction use the same format, however attributes, last,
and opcode fields are ignored by data moving which moves data back to the
memory.</p><p>The last field is the critical field for scatter-gather support: A stream is
terminated if last is set to high.</p><h3 id=7-5-driver:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>7.5 Driver</h3><p>Currently two drivers are provided, one for bare metal and one for Linux.</p><h4 id=7-5-1-bare-metal-driver:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>7.5.1 Bare-metal Driver</h4><p>This is a very basic driver provided without scatter-gather support. In bare
metal without MMU enabled, blocks are physically contiguous so scatter-gather
is not supported.</p><p>Three functions are provided in bare-metal:</p><pre><code class=language-c>// Issue an command to execute an stream processor
void videox_exec(int func, void* src, void* dest, size_t size, int attrib);
// Wait for all issued command to finish
void videox_wait();
// Do memory copy using the accelerator
void* fast_memcpy(void* dest, void* src, size_t size);
</code></pre><h4 id=7-5-2-linux-driver:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>7.5.2 Linux Driver</h4><p>The driver registers a miscellaneous device. The device file only support one
operation, which is ioctl. Within a driver, a queue is maintained internally,
and the external exposed interface mimics the one in bare metal.</p><pre><code class=language-c>// Query if all issued command are finished
int ret;
ioctl(fd, 0, &amp;ret);
// ret will be 1 if some instructions are still in FIFO

// Issue an instruction to video accelerator
struct request {
    void* src;
    void* dest;
    size_t len;
    int opcode;
    int attr;
};
struct request req = {...};
ioctl(fd, 1, &amp;req);
// Note req.src, req.dest, req.len must be 64-byte aligned
</code></pre><p>There are few limitations in the current driver. Memory mapping and memory
allocation happens in each frame so the accelerator is not useful is amount of
data is tiny. Lack of interrupt also cause us to rely on polling to determine
whether the command is finished.</p><hr><h2 id=8-accelerators:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>8. Accelerators</h2><p>In the final design, 3 special purpose accelerators were written for
optimising tasks on the MPEG-2 decode process. These accelerators were for
performing the Inverse-Discrete-Cosine-Transform (and the related
Discrete-Cosine-Transform), Y&rsquo;UV 422 to Y&rsquo;UV 444 upsampling, and the
conversion of Y&rsquo;UV 444 to RGB. Technical descriptions of these can be found in
the following section.</p><h3 id=8-1-dct-idct:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>8.1 DCT/IDCT</h3><p>Similar to how we can represent numbers using digits, we can also represent
functions with an equivalent of digits, basis functions. One particular way of
performing this task is using complex exponentials. If we take only the real
part of these basis functions we obtain what is called a cosine transform. Of
particular interest to us is the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_cosine_transform>discrete version of this
transform</a> due to
some of its mathematical properties.</p><p>DCT and IDCT are used in video compression to make the data more susceptible
to entropy coding by reducing the number of terms required to express the
data. This is possible due to the energy compacting nature of DCT. Using
knowledge about how we perceive images and zeroing terms that are of little
perceptual impact, it is possible to reproduce, after a DCT -&gt; Quantization
-&gt; Inverse Quantization -&gt; IDCT phase, an image that is very much similar to
the original.</p><p>DCT is performed when encoding data, and when using a differential coder or
motion compensation, IDCT is used in encoding as well. This is why DCT is
usually left unoptimized as it is seen as an offline task.</p><p>IDCT is performed during decoding and hence must be able to run on lower end
machines than DCT and be performed online/real-time. In our implementation,
we have chosen to move IDCT(and as a pair DCT) into
hardware as there is sufficient literature with regards to this task as well
as the familiarity with these operations from our courses.
Our design is as follows:</p><h5 id=8-1-1-the-1d-row-column-units:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>8.1.1 The 1D Row/Column units</h5><p><img src=../8_point_dct.png></p><p><em>Figure 1: The computation network for DCT-2 [1].</em></p><p>Here, $kC_n$ represents a rotation by $\frac{n*\pi}{16}$ multiplied by the

non-filled bubbles represent multiplication by a scalar (here $\sqrt2$).</p><p><em>The IDCT computation network is the same as DCT but executed in reverse
order, i.e. from right to left.</em></p><p>The 1D units can be used both on rows and columns without modification. No
floating point operations are necessary as dyadic fractions (fractions of the
form $\frac{n}{2^\alpha}$) are used to approximate the irrationals involved in
the rotation and scaling operations. Do, however, note that fixed point
multiplication is in fact used in both 1D units.</p><p><strong>Input:</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Variable</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>row</code></td><td><code>Packed array</code> of size <code>8</code> of integers*</td></tr><tr><td><code>en</code></td><td><code>Boolean</code> used to signal valid input</td></tr><tr><td><code>lock</code></td><td><code>Boolean</code> used to freeze the internal state</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Output:</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Variable</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>idct_row</code>/<code>dct_row</code></td><td><code>Packed array</code> of size <code>8</code> of integers**</td></tr><tr><td><code>out_en</code></td><td><code>Boolean</code> used to signal valid output</td></tr></tbody></table><p>*The size of the integers is determined by <code>COEF_WIDTH</code> (default: <code>32</code>)<br>** The output size is <code>COEF_WIDTH + 2</code> to reduce errors due premature

<em>64-bit data width bus</em>. Working from this assumption, we can load one row to
the pipeline from the data stream in $2$ cycles. Similarly for output, we can
send the data of a row via the stream in $2$ cycles. The choice was made as a
trade-off between requiring fewer cycles to load/store the data and having a
big enough range of numbers to cover the target use scenarios.</p><h3 id=8-2-idct-stream-processor:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>8.2 IDCT Stream processor</h3><p>A second iteration of the IDCT processor was a pure stream processor that was
made possible with the addition of the AXI-stream widener and narrower. In
this version we create a multi-stage stream processor that takes in a stream
that was widened to provide one full row of data per tick. We then widen the
stream again to provide the full matrix ($8 \times 8$ block) in one tick to
the transpose unit for the sake of simplifying transpose logic, which is then
narrowed to provide one row per tick to the second IDCT unit. Finally, we pass
it through a second transpose unit so that the results provided are identical
to the software implementation. This flow can be more easily seen
diagrammatically as such:</p><p><img src=../stream_idct.png style=width:600px></p><p><strong>Input/Output:</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Variable</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>in_ch</code></td><td>The input AXI-stream channel</td></tr><tr><td><code>out_ch</code></td><td>The output AXI-stream channel</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The stream handler uses the <em><code>lock</code></em> signal to stall the pipeline as necessary
for routine load/store or when either input or output is not ready.</p><p>A <code>stream_lock</code> signal is used for the situation when either input or output
is not ready so that the handler maintains the current state until we no
longer need to stall. This signal is generated via combinational logic from
the state of <code>in_ch</code> and <code>out_ch</code>.</p><p>The output is a stream of at least the same length as the input, however,
since it is a stream, we do not concern ourselves with the length as its end
will be denoted by a last signal.</p><p>Do note that incomplete inputs cause unexpected numeric results by padding
zero rows required so that the output is guaranteed to form an integer number
of $8\times8$ blocks.</p><h3 id=8-3-y-uv-422-to-444:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>8.3 Y&rsquo;UV 422 to 444</h3><p>Chroma sub-sampling is a common compression technique in image encoding which
implements less resolution for colour (UV) than for brightness (Y&rsquo;)
information. In Y&rsquo;UV422 the colour values are sampled at half the rate of the
brightness. In order to convert to RGB, we need to reintroduce this resolution
somehow. The accelerator we developed does this by simply repeating every
colour value twice. A more advanced system would be to interpolate the value
of the colour from the surrounding pixels, however this is left as an
extension.</p><p>The input to the processor is the standard Y&rsquo;UV422 packed format, shown below.</p><p><img src=../yuv422_packed.png></p><p>The output is the standard Y&rsquo;UV444 packed format, shown below. A zero byte is
padded on the end in order to bring the packet up to 32 bits, and allows the
possibility of future extensions using alpha-values.</p><p><img src=../yuv444_packed.png></p><p>The stream processor infrastructure uses a packet size of 64 bits, and so on
each cycle we read in 2 sets of Y&rsquo;UV422 values. Since we output 2 Y&rsquo;UV444
values for each Y&rsquo;UV422 value, we must output at twice the rate we input. In
order to do this the device is implemented as an implicit state machine.</p><p><img src=../yuv_state_machine.png style=width:500px></p><p>When the <code>src.t_valid</code> signal is set by the data source, we enter the <code>READ</code>
state, record the Y&rsquo;UV422 data from the <code>src.t_data</code> wire into a buffer, and
set the <code>src.t_ready</code> signal to low in order to prevent more data being sent
before it can be processed. We then enter the <code>WRITE_1</code> state. In this state
we output the first 2 packets of Y&rsquo;UV444 data on the <code>dst.t_data</code> wire and
assert <code>dst.t_valid</code>. We then remain in this state until the destination has
asserted <code>dst.t_ready</code>, and so the data transfer has occurred. We then
transition to the <code>READ &amp; WRITE_2</code> state in which we wait until we can write
the second 2 packets of Y&rsquo;UV444 data on the <code>dst.t_data</code> wire and assert
<code>dst.t_valid</code>. Once <code>dst.t_ready</code> is also asserted, we assert <code>src.t_ready</code>
for a cycle, read the next packet, and transition back to <code>WRITE_1</code>. We
alternate between these states until the data transfer is complete, at which
point we write the final data packet, assert <code>dst.t_last</code>, and enter the
<code>IDLE</code> state.</p><p>While this state machine was the basis of the design, optimisation on the
source led to the definition of the state machine being somewhat obfuscated in
the code, and appearing as a number of independent states. The transitions are
controlled by set of &lsquo;guards&rsquo; which only allow the data to move to the next
stage of the pipeline if the correct conditions are met.</p><p><img src=../yuv_422_444_pipeline.png style=width:500px></p><p>These guards are linked in such a way to allow the correct operation of the state machine.</p><h3 id=8-4-y-uv444-to-rgb888:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>8.4 Y&rsquo;UV444 to RGB888</h3><p>The final stage of decoding is to convert each pixel value from Y&rsquo;UV to RGB values, the standard for most monitors. The conversions between these is defined as follows:</p><p>$C = Y&rsquo; - 16$
$D = U - 128$
$E = V - 128$</p><p>$R = clamp((298 \times C + 409 \times E + 128) &gt;&gt; 8)$<br>$G = clamp((298 \times C - 100 \times D + 208 \times E + 128) &gt;&gt; 8)$<br>$B = clamp((298 \times C + 516 \times D + 128) &gt;&gt; 8)$<br></p><p>where $clamp()$ denotes clamping a value to the range of $0$ to $255$.</p><p>Since this operation involves a number of large multiplications and additions
this operation is pipelined in order to stay within the timing constraints.
The pipeline is shown below.</p><p><img src=../yuv444_rgb888_pipeline.png></p><p>In the first stage, once <code>src.t_valid</code> is set by the source, we read the data
and perform the initial subtractions to generate the $C$, $D$, and $E$ values.
In the multiply stage, we perform all the intermediate multiplications for
calculation $R$, $G$, and $B$. These multiplications are as follows:</p><p>$x_0 = 298 * c$<br>$y_0 = 100 * d$<br>$y_1 = 516 * d$<br>$z_0 = 409 * e$<br>$z_1 = 208 * e$<br></p><p>These multiplications are independent and so occur in parallel. The next stage
is the add stage, which computes the final RGB values by combining the
$x$,$y$,$z$ values of the previous stage. Finally we perform the clamping and<br>outputting to <code>dst.t_data</code> in one stage.</p><h3 id=8-5-rgb888-to-rgb565:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>8.5 RGB888 to RGB565</h3><p>In order to reduce the memory requirement of frames, RGB values were encoded
as 16-bit rather than 24-bit RGB. This was necessary due to the limited
resources of the FPGA. We used the standard 16-bit encoding of RGB values -
that is 5 bits for red and blue, and 6 bits for green.</p><p>The coding of this module is very simple due to the use of a
<code>nasti_stream_widener</code>. The widener handles the fact that for every 64 bits
input we only output 32-bits by buffering the first 32 bits until the next 32
bits are ready. Therefore the converter simply pipes the protocol values to
the narrower, manipulating the RGB values to use the correct bits. The
manipulation is as follows:</p><pre><code class=language-c>assign widener_ch.t_data  = {src.t_data[55:51],  // R
                             src.t_data[47:42],  // G
                             src.t_data[39:35],  // B
                             
                             src.t_data[23:19],  // R
                             src.t_data[15:10],  // G
                             src.t_data[ 7: 3]}; // B

integrate their code into a shared repository several times a day, with the
goal of reducing merge conflicts and catching bugs early. For this to be
effective, an automated build and test process is required.
lowRISC already had an automated test process using the cloud based <a href=https://travis-ci.com/>Travis
CI</a> continuous integration service and
<a href=https://www.docker.com/>Docker</a>. We extended this with a linting step, and
set up some independent FPGA based tests.</p><h3 id=9-1-travis-and-linting:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>9.1 Travis and Linting</h3><p>Linting is the process of analysing source code to flag potential issues.
During the build process, Verilator lints the input Verilog files and displays
warnings. Unfortunately, many of these are spurious, so we&rsquo;ve written a short
script that attempts to refine them (identifying important warnings using
regular expressions). This script is run during the automated testing, if
there are any remaining warnings after it has run, the build is considered a
failure.</p><h3 id=9-2-synthesis-and-scripts:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>9.2 Synthesis and Scripts</h3><p>Travis CI is cloud based, which has many benefits, but a significant downside
is that HDL code can only be tested via simulation. We found that several
errors only manifest when running on the FPGA, so it was desirable to automate
some FPGA tests to run alongside Travis.</p><p>We did this by having a local machine (with an FPGA turned on and plugged in)
periodically poll our main Github repository, when it discovered a new commit,
it pulled it and ran some FPGA tests using the new code. It reported the
result back to Github once it was finished, typically about half an hour
later.</p><hr><h2 id=10-final-results:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>10. Final Results</h2><h3 id=10-1-comparison-to-project-objectives:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>10.1 Comparison to Project Objectives</h3><p>A number of project objectives were described in section 4.2. In this section we will discuss each objective and whether it was met, and what could have been improved.</p><ul><li><em>Decoding MPEG-2 encoded video at a resolution of 640x480, and playing at a rate of 8 frames-per-second</em></li></ul><p>This objective was not met. Once integrated into lowRISC and synthesised on
our Naxys4 DDR FPGAs, our accelerators allowed us to decode 320x480 video at a
rate of approximately 2.5 frames-per-second. The limiting factor on decoding
proved to be the speed we were able to access memory through the TileLink bus.
This problem was further compounded by the fact that a bug forced us to
disable the L2 cache, and we were unable to resolve it before the end of the
project. The speed of the bus had been reduced to 25MHz due to the floating
point unit, and so more effort could have been expended on removing the FPU,
and increasing the speed of the bus.</p><ul><li><em>Tutorials describing</em><ul><li><em>Using the video output controller</em></li><li><em>Extending lowRISC with new devices</em></li><li><em>Adding additional accelerators using our infrastructure</em></li></ul></li></ul><p>These tutorials have been completed, and can be found on the <a href=https://www.lowrisc.org/>lowRISC website</a>.</p><ul><li><em>Technical descriptions of</em><ul><li><em>The accelerator infrastructure</em></li><li><em>The DCT/IDCT hardware device, including the control logic</em></li><li><em>The chroma conversion accelerators</em></li></ul></li></ul><p>These technical descriptions are included in this document.</p><h3 id=10-2-comparison-of-video-with-and-without-acceleration:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>10.2 Comparison of Video with and without Acceleration</h3><p>In order to compare the performance with and without acceleration, we
introduced instrumentation into the codec before and after the functions for
interacting with the accelerator. In this way we were able to capture the time
taken to perform these functions with and without the accelerators. The data
was gathered over a video of 658 frames and the values presented an average
over all frames in the video.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Function</th><th align=right>Software</th><th align=right>Hardware</th><th align=right><em>Speed-up</em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Y&rsquo;UV 422 to 444</td><td align=right>726ms</td><td align=right>20.9ms</td><td align=right><em>34.7</em></td></tr><tr><td>Y&rsquo;UV 444 to RGB</td><td align=right>216ms</td><td align=right>26.7ms</td><td align=right><em>8.08</em></td></tr><tr><td>RGB 32 to 16</td><td align=right>59.7ms</td><td align=right>10.4ms</td><td align=right><em>5.71</em></td></tr><tr><td>Total for Frame</td><td align=right>448ms</td><td align=right>160ms</td><td align=right><em>2.80</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p><em>Table: Time taken to perform accelerated tasks with and without accelerator</em></p><p>It is clear to see that for each of the individual accelerators provide a significant reduction in the CPU time needed for processing, with the conversion of Y&rsquo;UV 444 to RGB gaining a speed-up of over 8 times. However due Amdahl&rsquo;s law, the overall speed-up of the full process proved to be significantly less.</p><p>One significant factor which reduced the performance of the accelerated codec was the need for a number of memory accesses between each accelerator. The accelerators used memory as the communication medium for passing data. Performing this for each accelerator in each frame lead to a significant limiting of the performance obtained. In order to resolve this we introduced hardware pipe-lining, which allowed accelerators to be chained and data passed directly from one to the next. The effect of hardware pipelining can be seen below.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Mode</th><th align=right>Time</th><th align=right><em>Speed-up (over software)</em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Software</td><td align=right>448ms</td><td align=right>-</td></tr><tr><td>Hardware (Unpipelined)</td><td align=right>160ms</td><td align=right><em>2.80</em></td></tr><tr><td>Hardware (Pipelined)</td><td align=right>103ms</td><td align=right><em>4.33</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p><em>Table: Time taken to perform frame processing with and without hardware pipelining</em></p><p>As can be seen, hardware pipelining provided a significant speed-up over the unpipelined version. This further illustrates that, with our accelerators, the bottleneck to decoding is the speed memory can be accessed.</p><h2 id=10-3-limitations-and-design-decisions:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>10.3 Limitations and Design Decisions</h2><h3 id=10-3-1-stream-processing:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>10.3.1 Stream Processing</h3><p>Stream processing was a useful paradigm for acceleration of IDCT and simple interpolation, since it is very easy to simply stream the video data and have the processors work on it as it flows through. However the lack memory locations and lengths made it very difficult to perform certain tasks such as interpolation and converting Y&rsquo;UV 420 to Y&rsquo;UV 422 without a significant amount of buffering.</p><h3 id=10-3-2-machine-instructions:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>10.3.2 Machine Instructions</h3><p>An early discussion during the project was how best to accelerate the codec, by extending RISC-V with support for SIMD instructions, or by adding a memory mapped instruction buffer, placing our defined instructions into the buffer, and having the accelerator driver poll the size of the buffer for instructions in flight.</p><p>Of these options, extending the instructions set with SIMD instructions was the most elegant and appealing options. However it was a little beyond the scope of our project, since we lacked the expertise and time to do it properly. We had a discussion about the possibility of using <a href=http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs250/fa13/handouts/lab3-sumaccel.pdf>RoCC</a>, but decided to stick with a memory mapped accelerator for the simpleness and ability to support internally.</p><h3 id=10-3-3-interrupts:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>10.3.3 Interrupts</h3><p>As mentioned in an earlier section, the accelerator driver we implemented has no support for interrupts, and relies on polling for detecting when instructions are present or complete. As such the driver is less responsive than would be the ideal. In addition it is polling from user-space, which means each poll initialises a system call, taken a considerable number of cycles to complete.</p><hr><h2 id=11-future-work:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>11. Future work</h2><h3 id=11-1-memory:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>11.1 Memory</h3><p>During development a deadlock condition arose when interacting with the L2
cache. The exact cause of the deadlock proved to be difficult to reproduce
quickly, and so did not arise in simulation at all. The cause seemed to be
some interaction between cached and uncached transactions on the TileLink bus.
This may be a bug in Rocket&rsquo;s TileLink implementation, but we were unable to
fully confirm. Due to the limited time of our internship, and our lack of
knowledge of the Chisel language we avoided this problem by removing the L2
cache entirely. As one might expect, this significantly impacted the
performance of the codec. Part way through the internship an <a href=https://github.com/ucb-bar/uncore/commit/ad95aa79ce2aa694fa628c5f1cab101676581f0e>update to the
TileLink github
repository</a>
made reference to a fix for a &lsquo;L2 Writeback deadlock issue&rsquo;. Therefore a
future development would be to further evaluate this patch to determine if
this reflects the issue we encountered, and look to integrate these updates
into the lowRISC repository. If not, more work must be done to further isolate
the issue.</p><h3 id=11-2-driver-scatter-gather-support:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>11.2 Driver Scatter-Gather Support</h3><p>Currently the linux driver has support for scatter-gather instructions in physical memory, which is contiguous within user-space. A future extension would be to introduce full scatter-gather support - that is including the case where information is not contiguous within user space.</p><h3 id=11-3-y-uv-420-to-422-and-interpolation:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>11.3 Y&rsquo;UV 420 to 422 and Interpolation</h3><p>The infrastructure we developed used the AXI-Stream bus protocol. This made it
very easy to accelerate our streams of data, such as the data for a frame.
However the operation of converting Y&rsquo;UV 420 to 422 requires the duplication
of lines in order to reinsert the relevant values. Therefore it is necessary
to buffer each line, and then replay it before moving on to the next line.
AXI-Stream has no concept of length, and so introduces a challenge of
detecting when a line of data has been received, and when it must be replayed.</p><p>We come across a similar problem when introducing interpolation for
upsampling. Currently when converting from Y&rsquo;UV422 to Y&rsquo;UV444 we simply replay
the U and V values. It would instead be better to interpolate these values as
an average of the values above, below, before and after. This however would
require the buffering of 3 entire rows of data, and so presents the same
problems as the simple Y&rsquo;UV 420 to Y&rsquo;UV 422 transformation required.</p><p>An example interpolation using a vertical 1:2 interpolation filter is
presented here in C. This formula is for transforming the planar format, and
so would need to be manipulated in order to work on the packed format.</p><pre><code class=language-c>yuv444[w * (j-2)] = clamp(( 3 * yuv422[w * (j-3)]

the FPU. We intentionally designed our system to avoid using any floating
point operations, with the intention of removing the FPU and boosting the
clock rate to increase performance. Unfortunately, this proved to be too
difficult to do in our brief internship, while we successfully removed the FPU
and ran the codec, we could not increase the clock rate successfully. This is
because the clock rate is tightly coupled with several other components and we
didn&rsquo;t have the time or expertise to adjust everything correctly.
A future goal is boosting performance by removing the FPU and doubling the
clock rate to 50 MHz.</p><hr><h2 id=references:20fba17329d148d6311e836cc75b698f>References</h2><p>[1] Loeffler C., Lightenberg A., Moschytz G.
