handling with support for nested preempted interrupts.</li><li>Summary of current RISC-V interrupts<ul><li>Local interrupts are directly connected to one hart. There&rsquo;s no
arbitration between harts to service. Determine cause through xcause CSR.
Only two standard local interrupts (software, timer).</li><li>Global (external) interrupts are routed via the platform-level interrupt
controller (PLIC) which arbitrates between multiple harts claiming an
interrupt.</li></ul></li><li>The machine interrupt pending (mip) CSR contains bits for local software,
local timer, and external interrupts (from the PLIC). It tells you which
interrupts are present.</li><li>mie mirrors the layout of mip, and allows you to enable/disable interrupts.</li><li>mstatus keeps track of interrupt status, containing a small interrupt stack.</li><li>The interrupt is reported in the mcause CSR. The exception code indicates
which interrupt was responsible - you might have to then interrogate the PLIC
if it was an external interrupt.</li><li>mtvec (machine trap vector base) contains the address of the trap vector
(&lsquo;base&rsquo;). It also contains bits which control whether interrupts are direct
(all exceptions and interrupts jump to base) or vectored (exceptions go to
base, interrupts are vectored).</li><li>There&rsquo;s two parts of an interrupt: what you were doing when it happened
(state context), and what you&rsquo;re going to do. mepc and mstatus allow the
contact to be saved and restored.</li><li>Problems with current interrupts:<ul><li>Hardware preemption is only possible by switching privileged modes</li><li>Fixed priority for local interrupts</li><li>The vector table holds jumps instructions, which can only jump +/- 1MiB. A
free register would be required to jump further, resulting in even more
instructions.</li><li>PLIC has variable priority, but the vectoring must be done in software.</li><li>The PLIC needs two memory accesses: one to claim it, one to indicate
completion.</li><li>The Unix ABI (which is the only one that has been standardised) requires
many registers to be saved/restored.</li></ul></li><li>Have had input via multiple proposals: Andes, Syntacore, Seagate, Liviu
Ionescu, SiFive</li><li>There have been discussions on the list about the interrupt handler
interface for software. It comes down to a choice between having the interrupt
handler as a regular C function (requiring save/restore of all caller-save
registers in hardware or software) or an inline handler which uses a gcc
interrupt attribute to convert the function to always callee-save every
register. Krste suggests both approaches are needed.</li><li>Krste explains how an &ldquo;interrupt&rdquo; attribute on a C function might work. In
this example, every register is callee-saved, so registers are saved as you
need to use them.</li><li>If you then went to call a function using the C ABI you need to save/restore
8 arguments, 7 temporaries, and 1 return address. Even more if you have to
save the floating point context. Krste argues that moving this to hardware
isn&rsquo;t enough, you need a new ABI to reduce the amount of state.</li><li>A number of options have been proposed for vectoring.<ul><li>Having function pointers in a table. Downside is this is new functionality
you&rsquo;d have to add to a pipeline.</li><li>The SiFive proposal is to add a new +/-2GiB offset instruction which is
only visible in a new interrupt ISA mode. The advantage is the pipeline can
treat this as a regular instruction fetch, albeit with a different encoding.</li></ul></li><li>Would like to allow each interrupt to be configured with its privilege mode
and the &lsquo;interrupt level&rsquo; which describes the preemption level, and a
priority.</li><li>To manage preempted context state it&rsquo;s necessary to push/pop
mepc/mpp/mil/mie to a memory stack. You also need to remember the previous
interrupt level, &lsquo;mil&rsquo;. Now multiple levels must be tracked, which Krste
proposes could be stored in mcause.</li></ul><h2 id=risc-v-dsp-p-extension-proposal-chuan-hua-chang:d2f16b96a9dcad25ca9611e08b0e618f>RISC-V DSP (P) extension proposal: Chuan-Hua Chang</h2><ul><li>P extension task group will define and ratify a packed-SIMD DSP extension
containing instructions which operate on XLEN-bit integer registers. It will
also define compiler intrinsic functions that can be directly used in
high-level programming languages.</li><li>The initial proposal is based on the AndeStar V3 DSP ISA.</li><li>Supports e.g. 16-bit SIMD instructions with min, max, abs, compare, clip
operations. Similar for 8-bit SIMD.</li><li>GPR-based SIMD is more efficient for various embedded domains. It addresses
the need for high performance generic code processing as well as digital
signal processing.</li><li>Want to make this easy to use through intrinsic functions and optimised DSP
libraries.</li><li>For 64-bit data types, use pairs of GPRs on RV32. An implementation could of
course still use a 2R1W register file, but use multiple cycles to read a
64-bit value.</li><li>After the task group is created, bi-weekly meetings will be set up.</li></ul><h2 id=security-task-group-update-richard-newell:d2f16b96a9dcad25ca9611e08b0e618f>Security task group update: Richard Newell</h2><ul><li>The security group was previously a task group of the technical committee.
There is now a new security standing committee, at the same level with the
marketing and technical committees.</li><li>Task groups will be set up to look at cryptograpshic ISA extensions and
trusted execution environments for microcontroller</li><li>The full charter will be published on riscv.org</li></ul><h2 id=formal-assurance-for-risc-v-implementations-daniel-m-zimmerman:d2f16b96a9dcad25ca9611e08b0e618f>Formal assurance for RISC-V implementations: Daniel M. Zimmerman</h2><ul><li>Galois started with a focus on cryptography, but has broadened its scope to
&ldquo;high assurance everything&rdquo;</li><li>There are a range of definitions for RISC-V. The human-readable instruction
manual, mechanisations in the form of software simulators or hardware
implementations. The formal model working group have also been working on
this.</li><li>How can we provide assurance about these definitions / mechanisations?</li><li>Assurance means: the system does what it is supposed to do and doesn&rsquo;t do
anything else.</li><li>When trying to get assurance through compliance tests, a huge burden is put
on the shoulders of the test writers. Those conformance tests need to be 100%
complete. This also doesn&rsquo;t help determine if an implementation has
undesirable behaviours.</li><li>Alternatively, formally verify your system. Compile a model to RTL via
clash, then use equivalence checking tools to compare against your own
implementation.</li><li>Need machine-readable specification of the correctness and security of an
implementation as well as a way to measure the conformance of an
implementation.</li><li>How to validate a specification?<ul><li>Might perform rigorous validation through execution: ad hoc testing,
simulation coverage analysis, or bisimulation.</li><li>Alternatively perform rigorous verification through formal reasoning:
prove test benches always pass, verification coverage analysis, or
bisimulation.</li></ul></li><li>Security properties require a different approach. They typically have a
different form, e.g. &ldquo;the following property must never hold&rdquo;. Galois is
developing a DSL that lets you specify the architecture, correctness
properties and security properties of a hardware design. It&rsquo;s also working on
a security test suite.</li><li>Want to help systems engineers understand and explore the effects of design
and implementation decisions on power, performance, area, and security.</li><li>Status<ul><li>LANDO DSL is in early stages of development. Expect initial version before
2018 RISC-V summit</li><li>Security test suite: early stages of development</li><li>Metrics and measures: evaluating existing tools for PPA and looking at
existing metrics work for security</li><li>Dashboard: early stages of design</li><li>Feature model generation: early stages of design</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=undefined-unspecified-non-deterministic-and-implementation-defined-behavior-in-verifiable-specifications-clifford-wolf:d2f16b96a9dcad25ca9611e08b0e618f>Undefined, Unspecified, Non-deterministic, and Implementation Defined Behavior in Verifiable Specifications: Clifford Wolf</h2><ul><li>Users of an ISA specification<ul><li>Software engineers: just don&rsquo;t do anything that&rsquo;s not specified</li><li>Software security engineers: what can we expect from the hardware if we do
the thing that wasn&rsquo;t specified?</li><li>Hardware design engineers: do something safe and simple for anything not
specified. But what does safe mean?</li><li>Hardware verification engineers</li></ul></li><li>This presentation is a taxonomy of types of &lsquo;not specified&rsquo; behaviour, using
nomenclature taking from different domains.</li><li>Undefined behaviour: the &ldquo;just don&rsquo;t do that&rdquo; approach to not specifying
behaviour. The spec is void for any program as a whole if it does this
undefined behaviour once.</li><li>Could introduce an &lsquo;undefined value&rsquo;, but that has similar issues</li><li>Non-deterministic behaviour / unpredictable behaviour: allow more than one
choice, which may change under re-execution</li><li>Unspecified value: the instruction will return a value, but the spec doesn&rsquo;t
say which value</li><li>Implementation defined behaviour / value: similar to unspecified value /
behaviour, but the implementer must specify what it is.</li><li>Fully specified behaviour: the ideal choice for verification. Explicitly
state what all implementations must do.</li><li>Clifford strongly prefers implementation defined or fully specified
behaviour.</li></ul><h2 id=foundational-hpc-systems-in-2020-and-beyond-steven-wallach:d2f16b96a9dcad25ca9611e08b0e618f>Foundational HPC systems in 2020 and beyond: Steven Wallach</h2><ul><li>Architecture 1.0 (see Mark Hill paper). The world was very
processor-centric. CPUs with memory attached.</li><li>Architecture 2.0. Not just the ISA. Move towards memory-driven computing.<ul><li>Numerical processing is trivial, but achieving efficient memory access is
very hard.</li><li>Caches now need to be protected machine state.</li></ul></li><li>An RV128 working group is going to be started, chaired by Steven<ul><li>Propose a 64-bit object ID and 64-bit byte offset.</li></ul></li><li>On an RV128 system, have to be able to execute RV64 programs and map 64-bit

company&rsquo;s design, but really impact any CPU using speculation.</li><li>A timing attack is when a change in your program input affects the time of
another user.</li><li>There are 3 parts to a timing attack<ul><li>Victim runs code that leaks observable side effects</li><li>Attacker runs code affected by timing leaks</li><li>Attacker measures time his code took to run</li></ul></li><li>Chris built up a taxonomy of time leaks. Two axes: were are we leaking from,
and what are we directly leaking.</li><li>High level ideas:<ul><li>Don&rsquo;t leak any observable side-effects in the machine if speculation is
aborted</li><li>Avoid bandwidth interference between different time domains. Depending on
the time domain you care about, this could be bandwidth to a functional
unit.</li></ul></li><li>Modern speculative cores have 100-300 instructions in-flight, but not all
are speculative. About 25% are beyond the point of non-return.</li><li>Idea: do not update predictors speculatively.</li><li>Idea: Don&rsquo;t speculatively update the cache. Could get rid of fully inclusive
L1/L2/L3 caches in favour of neither exclusive nor inclusive (NENI) caches.
Then allocate only into the L1 cache.</li><li>Idea: misspeculation recovery should be deterministic. Any shared resource
can leak time</li><li>Idea: partition caches etc</li><li>Idea: dynamic partitioning</li><li>Idea: partial and full flushes. e.g. flush <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> BTB entries.</li><li>Many other ideas (see the full list in the slides!)</li></ul><h2 id=evaluation-of-risc-v-for-pixel-visual-core-matt-cockrell:d2f16b96a9dcad25ca9611e08b0e618f>Evaluation of RISC-V for Pixel Visual Core: Matt Cockrell</h2><ul><li>Background: the Pixel Visual Core is a Google-design Image Processing Unit
(IPU). It has a dedicated A53 which aggregates application layer IPU resource
requests.</li><li>Looking at adding a microcontroller as a job scheduling and dispatch unit.</li><li>When selecting a core, key considerations were: level of effort (how
difficult to integrate), risk (stability and reliability of support), and
license.</li><li>First candidate was the internal &lsquo;Bottle Rocket&rsquo; project. This implements
RV32IMC, reusing parts of the Rocket design. High level of effort, medium
risk.</li><li>Second candidate: Merlin (github.com/origintfj/riscv). Low level of effort,
high risk.</li><li>Third candidate: RI5CY, produced by the PULP team. Low level of effort,
medium risk.</li><li>Selected RI5CY for a number of reasons: it had been taped out, had good
infrastructure, the license was acceptable, and it was implemented in
SystemVerilog rather than Chisel.</li><li>Why SystemVerilog rather than Chisel?<ul><li>SystemVerilog builds on established physical design and verification flows</li><li>Chisel generated verilog loses designer&rsquo;s intent, making it difficult to
read and debug</li><li>Chisel generated code makes certain physical design items difficult such
as sync/asnc clocks, power domains, clock domains etc</li></ul></li><li>Next steps: add full compliance for privilege/debug specification and
evaluate performance impact after adding RI5CY to the Pixel Visual Core.</li></ul><h2 id=linux-ready-rv-gc-andescore-with-architecture-extensions-charlie-su:d2f16b96a9dcad25ca9611e08b0e618f>Linux-Ready RV-GC AndesCore with Architecture Extensions: Charlie Su</h2><ul><li>The AndeStar V5 architecture adopts RISC-V and adds pre-defined useful Andes

You need to
consider the entire system</li><li>An open approach has proven useful for security in software. Why should
hardware be any different?</li><li>Cryptographic accelerators can easily achieve high throughput with low area.</li><li>PULP provides multiple opportunities to add extensions. e.g. new
instructions added directly to the core, adding peripherals to the bus, or
hardware accelerators with direct memory access</li><li>Implemented Fulmine, an IoT processor with accelerators. Added two TCDM
ports, 64bits/cycle. The AES unit performs 2 rounds a cycle, 1.76Gbit/s and
120pJ per byte (entire chip) at 0.8V and 84MHz</li><li>Side channel attacks are a huge challenge. Recently implemented a leakage
resilient accelerator which reduces the attack surface by generating a new key
per data block. This provides 5.29Gbit/s throughput at 256Mhz</li><li>Attacks that target control flow are a serious problem and can be realized
in both hardware (e.g. glitching) or software. Implemented and published
sponge based control-flow protection (SCFP), which stores instructions
encrypted in memory. As instructions must be decrypted, the attacker would
