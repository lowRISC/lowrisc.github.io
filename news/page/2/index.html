This has led to a growing awareness among most businesses and households of important mitigations like encryption, 2-factor authentication and verified software updates. But guess what? There&rsquo;s an unsung hero behind all these safeguards that underpins their effectiveness: the silicon Root of Trust (RoT).
And yet, despite the vital role these RoTs play, few people, including even security professionals, are familiar with what a Root of Trust is — or in fact that it even exists.</p><p><a href=/news/2022/10/introducing-the-foundation-of-true-security/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/news/2022/10/claudia-eckert-joins-board/>lowRISC Appoints Cybersecurity Expert Prof. Dr. Claudia Eckert to Board of Directors</a></h2><h5><time>October 5, 2022</time></h5><p class=text-justify>CAMBRIDGE, United Kingdom, Oct. 5th, 2022 – lowRISC C.I.C., the open source system on a chip (SoC) organization, today announced the appointment of Prof. Dr. Claudia Eckert to its board of directors.

The tool works by generating random C programs, compiling each program with both Clang and GCC (targeting RISC-V) and comparing the assembly generated by both compilers. If it estimates that Clang/LLVM generated worse code than GCC then it saves that case for further analysis.</p><p><a href=/news/2020/10/how-we-used-differential-testing-to-rapidly-find-and-fix-missed-optimisation-opportunities-in-llvms-risc-v-backend/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/news/2020/09/gsoc-projects-successfully-completed/>GSoC Projects Successfully Completed</a></h2><h5><time>September 14, 2020</time></h5><p class=text-justify>Time is ticking and summer is almost over already.
