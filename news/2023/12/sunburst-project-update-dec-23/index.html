Its primary goal is to promote the adoption of CHERIoT, an open-source microcontroller technology that integrates CHERI capabilities within the RISC-V architecture.</p><p>Today <a href=https://lowrisc.org>lowRISC</a> and <a href=https://newae.com>NewAE</a> are pleased to announce we&rsquo;ve already made significant strides towards that goal, which we&rsquo;ll briefly review in this blog!</p><p>But first, a little history of how we got here, what CHERI is all about, and why it matters.</p><h2 id=sunburst-s-backstory:dd926931818a439aac447cd2c9cdc6c4>Sunburst&rsquo;s Backstory</h2><p><a href=https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/>CHERI</a> was developed jointly by the University of Cambridge and SRI International to enable enforcement of fine-grained memory protection and scalable software compartmentalisation at the hardware (processor) level.
It has the potential to <a href=https://github.com/microsoft/MSRC-Security-Research/blob/master/presentations/2019_02_BlueHatIL/2019_01%20-%20BlueHatIL%20-%20Trends%2C%20challenge%2C%20and%20shifts%20in%20software%20vulnerability%20mitigation.pdf>prevent around 70% of current exploits</a> (hacks), without requiring legacy software — which is typically written in unsafe languages such as C — to be completely recoded in safer, more modern languages like Rust.</p><p>That&rsquo;s huge.
However, CHERI&rsquo;s original focus on &lsquo;full fat&rsquo; deployment targets left this transformative security technology out of reach for many embedded and OpTe use cases, where very tight power, area and financial budgets are the norm.</p><p>Enter <a href=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/cheriot-rethinking-security-for-low-cost-embedded-systems/>CHERIoT</a>.
This Microsoft-developed architecture extension brings CHERI features to the 32-bit RISC-V microcontroller domain, and Microsoft recently open-sourced a first, real-world implementation of it based on lowRISC&rsquo;s popular <a href=https://github.com/lowRISC/ibex>Ibex</a> CPU core.
This <a href=https://github.com/microsoft/cheriot-ibex>CHERIoT-Ibex</a> design has very modest power and area requirements, making it viable even for highly resource-constrained applications, such as OpTe.</p><p>The Sunburst Project, in turn, was set up to leverage and popularize CHERIoT, by delivering a) a low-cost evaluation board hosting that baseline CHERIoT-Ibex implementation (codenamed “Sonata”); and b) a more fully-featured top-level design unifying the mature <a href=https://opentitan.org/>OpenTitan</a> silicon root of trust with CHERIoT-Ibex (codenamed “Symphony”).</p><p>With that necessary background under our belt, let&rsquo;s take a look at progress so far!</p><h2 id=github-release-of-sonata-and-symphony-architectures:dd926931818a439aac447cd2c9cdc6c4>GitHub Release of Sonata and Symphony Architectures</h2><p>This first milestone is really important: we have already released the initial <a href=https://github.com/lowRISC/sonata-system/>Sonata</a> and <a href=https://github.com/lowRISC/symphony-system/>Symphony</a> architecture documentation on GitHub! This not only promotes transparency, it is also a means to invite and facilitate collaboration from the wider community.</p><h2 id=community-engagement:dd926931818a439aac447cd2c9cdc6c4>Community Engagement</h2><p>Continuing on that theme, the Sunburst Project — recognizing the value of collective intelligence — actively welcomes comments and suggestions from the wider community.
By fostering an open-source culture, we encourage engineers, developers, and security enthusiasts to contribute to the improvement and refinement of our evaluation platforms.
For example, we convene a Technical Interest Group meeting by videoconference once a month (in addition to mailing lists etc).
Please contact <a href=mailto:info@lowrisc.org>info@lowrisc.org</a> if you&rsquo;d like to be added to the meeting invite!</p><h2 id=schematics-and-design-files-for-sonata-released:dd926931818a439aac447cd2c9cdc6c4>Schematics and Design Files for Sonata Released</h2><p>The Sonata board, a key deliverable of the Sunburst Project, recently achieved a crucial milestone with the <a href=https://github.com/newaetech/sonata-pcb>release of its schematics and design files</a> on NewAE&rsquo;s GitHub repository, underlining further the project&rsquo;s commitment to openness (NewAE is a wholly owned subsidiary of lowRISC).</p><p>Engineers are now free to use and modify the designs under the permissive Apache 2.0 licence, promoting innovation and customization within the community!</p><img srcset="https://www.lowrisc.org/news/2023/12/sunburst-project-update-dec-23/sonata-pcb_hu1e063af0ec2f91e0d0f1d798191bd275_689818_700x0_resize_box_2.png 1x, https://www.lowrisc.org/news/2023/12/sunburst-project-update-dec-23/sonata-pcb_hu1e063af0ec2f91e0d0f1d798191bd275_689818_1400x0_resize_box_2.png 2x" src=https://www.lowrisc.org/news/2023/12/sunburst-project-update-dec-23/sonata-pcb_hu1e063af0ec2f91e0d0f1d798191bd275_689818_700x0_resize_box_2.png alt="Early Sonata PCB Prototype and Layout" title="Early Sonata PCB Prototype and Layout" class="d-block align-middle img-fluid mx-auto"><p><em><p style=text-align:center>Early Sonata PCB Prototype and Layout</p></em></p><h2 id=sonata-prototype-board-availability:dd926931818a439aac447cd2c9cdc6c4>Sonata Prototype Board Availability</h2><p>In line with the project&rsquo;s commitment to get usable CHERI technology into the hands of embedded system engineers, the Sunburst Project is preparing 100 of these prototype CHERIoT-Ibex Sonata boards for free distribution to qualifying institutions in the first half of 2024 (please contact <a href=mailto:info@lowrisc.org>info@lowrisc.org</a> for details).</p><p>A version of these prototype boards will also be made available commercially through distribution channels such as Mouser, making them accessible in higher volumes to a broader audience. Of course, since the design is fully open, you are also free to build your own, or create a modified version tailored to your needs!</p><h2 id=symphony-development-on-newae-s-cw340-fpga-board:dd926931818a439aac447cd2c9cdc6c4>Symphony Development on NewAE&rsquo;s CW340 FPGA Board</h2><p>The Symphony evaluation platform integrates CHERIoT-ibex with an OpenTitan root of trust, targeting NewAE&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.mouser.co.uk/ProductDetail/NewAE/NAE-CW340-OTKIT?qs=1Kr7Jg1SGW%2FOdmbWKP8ZGA%3D%3D">CW340 FPGA board</a> for emulation.
This feature-rich design aims to facilitate a comprehensive analysis of CHERI enhancements within a broader embedded system, allowing the evaluation of CHERI in applications that also require the strong, additional security guarantees provided by an onboard root of trust.</p><h2 id=looking-forward-to-2024:dd926931818a439aac447cd2c9cdc6c4>Looking Forward to 2024</h2><p>The Sunburst Project, made possible by DSbD/UKRI grant funding, is on track to revolutionize embedded and OpTe device security by advancing the uptake of CHERIoT technology.</p><p>We invite you to join us as we continue our journey into 2024. Help us shape the future of secure hardware and contribute to a safer digital landscape for everyone!</p><p><em>Media Contact: <a href=mailto:lowRISC@w2comm.com>lowRISC@w2comm.com</a></em></p></article></div></main><footer class=lr-footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-2 d-none d-lg-block"><img src=/img/logo/logo-dualcolor.svg width=150px></div><div class=col><p><small>The text content on this website is licensed under a <a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>, except where otherwise noted.
