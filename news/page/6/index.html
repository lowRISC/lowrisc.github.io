Katherine&rsquo;s focus was on operating system and software enabled for lowRISC&rsquo;s tagged memory, building upon our most recent milestone release. As Katherine&rsquo;s detailed write-up demonstrates, it&rsquo;s been a very productive summer.
The goal of this internship was to take the lowRISC hardware release, and demonstrate kernel support and software support for the hardware tagged memory primitives.</p><p><a href=/news/2017/09/lowrisc-tagged-memory-os-enablement/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/news/2017/09/were-hiring-work-on-making-open-source-hardware-a-reality/>We&#39;re hiring!

lowRISC C.I.C. is a not-for-profit company that aims to demonstrate, promote and support the use of open-source hardware. The lowRISC project was established in 2014 with the aim of bringing the benefits of open-source to the hardware world. It is working to do this by producing a high quality, secure, open, and flexible System-on-Chip (SoC) platform.</p><p><a href=/news/2017/09/were-hiring-work-on-making-open-source-hardware-a-reality/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/news/2017/09/building-upstream-risc-v-gccbinutilsnewlib-the-quick-and-dirty-way/>Building upstream RISC-V GCC&#43;binutils&#43;newlib: the quick and dirty way</a></h2><h5><time>September 5, 2017</time></h5><p class=text-justify>There are a number of available options for building a RISC-V GCC toolchain. You might use the build system from the riscv/riscv-tools repository, or investigate toolchain generators such as crosstool-ng. However in the case of riscv-tools, it&rsquo;s not always clear how this corresponds to the code in the relevant upstream projects. When investigating a potential bug, you often just want to build the latest upstream code with as little fuss as possible.</p><p><a href=/news/2017/09/building-upstream-risc-v-gccbinutilsnewlib-the-quick-and-dirty-way/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/news/2017/06/lowrisc-0-4-milestone-release/>lowRISC 0-4 milestone release</a></h2><h5><time>June 9, 2017</time></h5><p class=text-justify>The lowRISC 0.4 milestone release is now available. The various changes are best described in our accompanying documentation, but in summary this release:
Moves forward our support for tagged memory by re-integrating the tag cache, reducing overhead with a hierarchical scheme. This will significantly reduce caches misses caused by tagged memory accesses where tags are distributed sparsely. Integrates support for specifying and configuring tag propagation and exception behaviour. A PULPino based &ldquo;minion core&rdquo; has been integrated, and is used to provide peripherals such as the SD card interface, keyboard, and VGA tex display (when using the Nexys4 DDR FPGA development board).</p><p><a href=/news/2017/06/lowrisc-0-4-milestone-release/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/news/2017/03/apply-now-for-gsoc-2017/>Apply now for GSoC 2017</a></h2><h5><time>March 27, 2017</time></h5><p class=text-justify>We are very grateful for being selected again to take part as a mentoring organisation in the Google Summer of Code, now for the third year running.

OpenSoC System Architect: Farzad Fatollahi-Fard Current architectures are wasteful. Only a small fraction of chip area goes to computation. For both GoblinCore and OpenHPC, ended up doing a lot of similar work to achieve only a point design. Why not make a generator to avoid repeating the same steps?</p><p><a href=/news/2016/11/fifth-risc-v-workshop-day-two/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/news/2016/11/fifth-risc-v-workshop-day-one/>Fifth RISC-V Workshop: Day One</a></h2><h5><time>November 29, 2016</time></h5><p class=text-justify>The fifth RISC-V workshop is going on today and tomorrow at the Google&rsquo;s Quad Campus in Mountain View.

There are a wide range of online services to help produce and maintain Gantt charts, but none quite offered what I was looking for.</p><p><a href=/news/2016/10/generating-a-gantt-chart-from-hjson-input/>Read More…</a></p></div><img class="align-self-center rounded ml-3 d-none d-md-block" alt="Example Gantt Chart" title="Example Gantt Chart" srcset="/news/2016/10/generating-a-gantt-chart-from-hjson-input/gantt_example_weekly_hu057eb1bfce3147217ea2f80a1940b12e_32473_150x0_resize_box_2.png 1x, /news/2016/10/generating-a-gantt-chart-from-hjson-input/gantt_example_weekly_hu057eb1bfce3147217ea2f80a1940b12e_32473_300x0_resize_box_2.png 2x" src=/news/2016/10/generating-a-gantt-chart-from-hjson-input/gantt_example_weekly_hu057eb1bfce3147217ea2f80a1940b12e_32473_150x0_resize_box_2.png></article><div class=lr-blog-list-pagination><ul class=pagination><li class=page-item><a href=/news/ class=page-link aria-label=First><span aria-hidden=true>&laquo;&laquo;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/news/page/5/ class=page-link aria-label=Previous><span aria-hidden=true>&laquo;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/news/>1</a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/news/page/2/>2</a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/news/page/3/>3</a></li><li class="page-item disabled"><span aria-hidden=true>&nbsp;&hellip;&nbsp;</span></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/news/page/5/>5</a></li><li class="page-item active"><a class=page-link href=/news/page/6/>6</a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/news/page/7/>7</a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/news/page/8/>8</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/news/page/7/ class=page-link aria-label=Next><span aria-hidden=true>&raquo;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/news/page/8/ class=page-link aria-label=Last><span aria-hidden=true>&raquo;&raquo;</span></a></li></ul></div></div></main><footer class=lr-footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-2 d-none d-lg-block"><img src=/img/logo/logo-dualcolor.svg width=150px></div><div class=col><p><small>The text content on this website is licensed under a <a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>, except where otherwise noted.
