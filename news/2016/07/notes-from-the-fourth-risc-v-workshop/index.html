been in Boston this week for the fourth RISC-V workshop. By any measure, this
has been a massive success with over 250 attendees representing 63 companies
and 42 Universities. Wei presented our most recent work on integrating trace
debug, which you&rsquo;ll soon be able to read much more about here (it&rsquo;s worth
signing up to our <a href=https://www.lowrisc.org/about/>announcement list</a> if you want to
be informed of each of our releases).</p><h2 id=risc-v-foundation-update-rick-o-connor:24dd012cacead39c1aa2537e4e61f3e1>RISC-V Foundation update: Rick O&rsquo;Connor</h2><ul><li>Next RISC-V Workshop will be Nov 29th-30th at Google&rsquo;s Mountain View, CA</li><li>The RISC-V ISA and related standards shall remain open and license-free to
all parties, and the member agreement with RISC-V Foundation will include a
license for the trademark</li><li>Trademark license for commercial use is part of being a silver, gold, or
platinum member</li><li>Founding member status has now finished.</li><li>You don&rsquo;t have to be a member to participate in specifications - each task
group must include at least one round of public consultation.</li><li>Question: any plans for workshops outside of the USA? Answer: yes, we would
like to do that</li></ul><h2 id=risc-v-interrupts-krste-asanović:24dd012cacead39c1aa2537e4e61f3e1>RISC-V interrupts: Krste Asanović</h2><ul><li>Want a standard that is useful in high performance Unix-like systems (fast
cores, smart devices), low/mid embedded systems (slow cores, dumb devices),
and high-performance realtime systems (can&rsquo;t waste time on interrupt overhead)</li><li>Design goals: simplicity, support all kinds of platforms, allow tradeoffs
between performance and implementation cost, be flexible to support
specialised needs</li><li>Interrupts are either local or global.<ul><li>Local interrupts are directly connected to one hardware thread (hart) with
no arbitration. On RISC-V, there is currently only two of these: software
and timer.</li><li>For global (external) interrupts, they are routed via the memory-mapped
Platform-Level Interrupt Controller (PLIC)</li></ul></li><li>A new CSR, the Machine Interrupt Pending (mip) register is added. It has
separate interrupts for each supported privilege level.</li><li>User-level interrupt handling is an optional feature. This may be used in
secure embedded systems.</li><li>Software interrupts<ul><li>MSIP (machine software interrupt) can only be written in machine mode via
a memory-mapped control register. This is used for inter-hart interrupts.
Also have HSIP, SSIP, USIP. A hart can only write its own HSIP, SSIP, USIP.</li><li>The App/OS/Hypervisor can only perform inter-hart interrupts via
ABI/SBI/HBI calls</li></ul></li><li>Timer interrupts: MTIP is a single 64-bit real-time hardware timer and
comparator in M-mode. You want this because due to frequency scaling etc, just
going by cycle count is not useful. HTIP, STIP, UTIP are set up by M-mode
software.</li><li>When running at a given privilege level, all interrupts for lower levels are
disabled.</li><li>All interrupts trap to M-mode by default, and M-mode software can redirect
to the other privilege level as necessary. mideleg can be used to
automatically delegate interrupts to the next privilege level.</li><li>Conceptually, when interrupts come in to the PLIC they are handled by the
gateway. This abstracts away differences between different interrupt sources.
e.g. level-triggered, edge-triggered etc. A new request isn&rsquo;t forwarded to the
PLIC core unless the previous request&rsquo;s handler has signaled completion.</li><li>Each interrupt has an ID and priority. These priorities can be fixed or
variable. The PLIC stores per-target information</li><li>An interrupted hart will try to claim an interrupt from the PLIC with a read
of the memory-mapped register. It could have been claimed by someone else, and
the PLIC core is responsible for ensuring the interrupts it received by only
one hart.</li><li>If you want to add more levels of nested interrupt handling, add more harts
to your system.</li><li>The position of the PLIC in the memory map isn&rsquo;t defined by the
specification because many people will have existing memory maps.</li><li>Question: would you have multiple PLICs on a multi-core system? Answer:
conceptually, there is only one PLIC though it could be implemented in a
distributed fashion.</li></ul><h2 id=formal-specification-of-risc-v-uniprocessor-consistency-arvind:24dd012cacead39c1aa2537e4e61f3e1>Formal specification of RISC-V uniprocessor consistency: Arvind</h2><ul><li>Joint project with Adam Chlipala. The slogan is &ldquo;chips with proofs&rdquo;. These
are multicore chips that satisfy the RISC-V ISA specifications and are capable
of booting Linux.</li><li>Both the design and the proofs must be modular and amenable to modular
refinement.</li><li>Mostly concerned about microarchitecture and memory system correctness.</li><li>Specs and designs are expressed in Bluespec.</li><li>See also <a href=http://plv.csail.mit.edu/kami/>Kami</a>, a framework for Coq for
performing proofs about Bluespec programs.</li><li>A specification should avoid using concepts such as partially executed
instructions or &ldquo;a store was been performed with respect to&hellip;&rdquo;.
Non-determinism is necessary, but unspecified behaviour should be avoided.</li><li>Semantics are defined in terms of &lsquo;I2E&rsquo;, the Instantaneous Instruction
Execution framework. Simply, an instruction executes instantaneously ensuring
the processor state is always up to date. Data moves between processors and
memory asynchronously according to some background rules. Memory
model-specific buffers are placed between the processor state and memory.</li><li>WMM is a possible memory model for RISC-V, where both loads and stores can
be re-ordered. Conceptually, invalidation buffers are added alongside the
store buffer in order to make stale values visible. Whenever a stale value is
removed from the invalidation buffer, any values that are older (more stale)
must also be removed.</li><li>Memory issues arise even within a uniprocessor, due to self-modifying code
and page table access and the TLB. The fundamental issue is with multiple
paths to the same memory.</li><li>Arvind is concerned that when defining formal semantics, a very weak memory
model may become very (too?) complex.</li></ul><h2 id=heterogeneous-multicore-risc-v-processors-in-fd-soi-silicon-thomas-peyret:24dd012cacead39c1aa2537e4e61f3e1>Heterogeneous Multicore RISC-V Processors in FD-SOI Silicon: Thomas Peyret</h2><ul><li>Want to build a large ecosystem around FD-SOI in Europe, including IP and
chipset libraries.</li><li>PULSAR is a RISC-V big.LITTLE-style heterogeneous multicore. Two small cores
(rocket without FPU, 8KB L1 caches) and two big cores (3-way super-scalar BOOM
and 32KB L1 caches). It features an AMBA interconnect generated by Synopsys
CoreAssembler and has multiple body-bias zones.</li><li>Currently looking to use it in the context of a pedestrian navigation
system.</li><li>128-bit link to DDR5 controller, plus 4+4GTX SERDES to a separate FPGA.</li><li>Also features the AntX processor, which is a very small 32-bit RISC Harvard
design from CEA Tech.</li><li>Used hardware emulation with ZeBu (Synopsys)</li><li>Also used SESAM for virtual prototyping (based on SystemC/TLM 2.0). This is
up to 90% accurate compared to RTL. Have also developed SCale, a new parallel
SystemC kernel.</li><li>Synthesis results show 2.64mm2, 0.6W, 700MHz.</li><li>Question: will the work be open-sourced? Answer: Don&rsquo;t know yet.</li></ul><h2 id=nvidia-risc-v-evaluation-story-joe-xie:24dd012cacead39c1aa2537e4e61f3e1>NVidia RISC-V evaluation story: Joe Xie</h2><ul><li>Want to reproduce the existing NVIDIA falcon CPU with a new ISA</li><li>Falcon - FAst Logic CONtroller. Introduced over 10 years ago and used in
more than 15 different hardware engines today. Low area, secure, flexible. 6
stage pipeline, variable length instructions (proprietary NVIDIA ISA).</li><li>The next generation for Falcon is needed for higher performance and rich OS
support. Old Falcon is 0.67 DMIPS/MHz, 1.4 Coremark/Mhz</li><li>Options were to buy access to a current architecture (MIPS, ARM, others) or
build (move to RISC-V or improve Falcon). Obviously, they elected to move to
RISC-V. The fact the ISA is extensible is a key advantage. Want an area of
less than 0.1mm2 at 16FF.</li><li>NV-RISCV is 5 stage in-order issue, out-of-order execution. It has a
in-order write buffer. No FPU. Makes use of an MPU with base and bound
protection. It will initially be added to the Falcon as a 2nd core to provide
easy backwards compatibility.</li><li>Area for 16FF: Falcon 0.03mm2 vs Rocket 0.055mm2 vs NV-RISC-V 0.05-0.06mm2.</li><li>Did a lot of cache optimisations to tolerate large latency. Store buffer,
write merging, line-fill buffer, victim buffer, stream buffer.</li><li>Areas of interest include toolchain (for automotive, debug, performance
tuning, flexibility, ilp32/ilp64). Also security (crypto instructions and
extensions), and adding cache manipulation instructions.</li><li>Question: why design your own core rather than use an existing one? Answer:
after evaluating the options, it made the most sense. The motivation to go to
RISC-V was technical as well as influenced by cost.</li></ul><h2 id=isa-shootout-a-comparison-of-risc-v-arm-and-x86-chris-celio:24dd012cacead39c1aa2537e4e61f3e1>ISA Shootout – a Comparison of RISC-V, ARM, and x86: Chris Celio</h2><ul><li>Recently released a new tech report <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02318>The renewed case for the Reduced
Instruction Set Computer</a>.</li><li>The conventional wisdom is that CISC ISAs are more expressive and dense than
RISC ISAs, while RISC ISAs map well to high-performance pipelines. Of course,
a number of designs have CISC instructions translating to RISC-like micro-ops.</li><li>Chris&rsquo; contention is that a well designed RISC ISA can be very competitive
with CISC ISAs. It can be denser and higher performance.</li><li><code>ldmiaeq sp!, {r4-r7, PC}</code> is an ARMv7 instruction (load
multiple-increment-address) which will write to 7 registers and perform 6
loads. This is a common idiom for stack pop and return from a function call.</li><li>Goal is to get a baseline to measure the current code generation quality of
the RISC-V gcc port. Given a fixed ISA, what can the compiler do to improve
performance? What can the programmer do? What can the micro-architect do? A
specific non-goal is to lobby for more instructions (CISC or otherwise).</li><li>Dynamic instruction count can be very misleading due to the possibility it
decodes to many micro-ops. Conversely, macro-op fusion may take multiple
instructions and fuse them on the fly.</li><li>Looking at 6 ISAs, using 12 benchmarks from SpecINT 2006.</li><li>Average 16% more instructions for RISC-V vs x86-64, though roughly even in
terms of micro-ops. With the compressed instruction set extension, RISC-V wins
in terms of instruction bytes fetched on many of the benchmarks. Overall, 28%
fewer instruction bytes than ARMv7 and 8% fewer than x86-64.</li><li>Adding array indices is the most common idiom, so why not add an indexed
load instruction to match x86? But with the compressed ISA, a pair of
compressed instructions can be treated as an indexed load by the decoder.</li><li>Proposed macro-op fusion pairs: load effective address, indexed load, clear
upper word. These idioms provide 5.4% fewer &ldquo;effective&rdquo; instructions for RV64.</li><li>Fusion isn&rsquo;t just for superscalar out-of-order cores. Chris believes it
should be used by all RISC-V cores. For instance, Rocket (single issue) can be
modified to perform this.</li><li>Better code generation is possible if the compiler knows fusion is
available.</li><li>RISC can be denser, faster, and stay simple!</li><li>Question: will compressed become standard? Answer: it may become part of the
de-facto standard or even Linux ABI standard. Still more to be done to fully
understand the complexity for processor implementations.</li><li>Question: how does macro-op fusion interact with things like faults and
precise exceptions? Answer: it does add extra complexity. One solution is if
you get a fault, then re-fetch and execute without fusion.</li></ul><h2 id=trace-debugging-in-lowrisc-wei-song:24dd012cacead39c1aa2537e4e61f3e1>Trace debugging in lowRISC: Wei Song</h2><ul><li>Watch this blog for much more on our trace debug work very soon.</li></ul><h2 id=risc-v-i-o-scale-out-architecture-for-distributed-data-analytics-mohammad-akhter:24dd012cacead39c1aa2537e4e61f3e1>RISC-V I/O Scale Out Architecture for Distributed Data Analytics: Mohammad Akhter</h2><ul><li>For analytics, need a deep net with many nodes.

Debian infrastructure but not part of the stable release process), and others
are outside of Debian infrastructure (e.g. Raspbian).</li><li>Why a Debian port for RISC-V? Interested as Manuel feels affinity with the
goals of the project, previously enjoyed working with the OpenRISC port.</li><li>Goal is to have a complete, fully supported, continuously updated Debian
port. The initial step is to bootstrap a viable, basic OS disk image.</li><li>The chosen RISC-V target is 64-bit little endian. This is the recommended
default and what is planned for the lowRISC board.</li><li>Been working on and off since November 2014. Upstreaming of toolchains etc
would be very helpful. Have now built 300-400 &ldquo;essential&rdquo; packages.</li><li>Packages where mostly cross-compiled, with some compiled &lsquo;natively&rsquo; inside
emulators. Some require building multiple times to e.g. break circular
dependencies.</li><li>ABI changes mean work has to restart from scratch.</li></ul><h2 id=kami-a-framework-for-hardware-verification-murali-vijayaraghavan:24dd012cacead39c1aa2537e4e61f3e1>Kami. A framework for hardware verification: Murali Vijayaraghavan</h2><ul><li>This work is part of the &ldquo;Riscy Expedition&rdquo; by MIT. Want to build chips with
proofs.</li><li>Must to able to verify an optimisation is correct independent of contexts,
to enable modular verification of a full system.</li><li>Kami is a DSL inside the Coq proof assistant for verifying Bluespec-style
hardware.</li><li>Have finished building required theory and proof automation infrastructure.<br>Are currently working on proving a cluster of multi-cycle cores connected to a
coherent cache hierarchy implements sequential consistency.</li></ul></article></div></main><footer class=lr-footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-2 d-none d-lg-block"><img src=/img/logo/logo-dualcolor.svg width=150px></div><div class=col><p><small>The text content on this website is licensed under a <a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>, except where otherwise noted.
