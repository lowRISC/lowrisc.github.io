Responses so far are extremely positive, and we&rsquo;re working to ensure this is a smooth process. This means that from 9.0, the RISC-V backend will be built by default for LLVM, making it usable out of the box for standard LLVM/Clang builds. As well as being more convenient for end users, this also makes it significantly easier for e.</p><p><a href=/news/2019/07/risc-v-llvm-backend-in-clang-llvm-9.0/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/news/2019/07/introducing-sam/>Introducing Sam</a></h2><h5><time>July 8, 2019</time></h5><p class=text-justify>On June 1st, Sam Elliott followed Laura and Pirmin in becoming lowRISC’s newest employee.

&ldquo;I joined lowRISC CIC as a Compiler Developer, working on the RISC-V LLVM backend, and so far I’m enjoying working on the team!

In implementation, this dream becomes a piece of hardware, with digital or analog logic, sensors, actuators, and much more.</p><p><a href=/news/2019/06/an-update-on-ibex-our-microcontroller-class-cpu-core/>Read More…</a></p></div><img class="align-self-center rounded ml-3 d-none d-md-block" alt="Ibex block diagram" title="Ibex block diagram" srcset="/news/2019/06/an-update-on-ibex-our-microcontroller-class-cpu-core/Ibex_block_diagram-100619_hu64d0b4d86cd0ba0563db9df884419228_38933_150x0_resize_box_2.png 1x, /news/2019/06/an-update-on-ibex-our-microcontroller-class-cpu-core/Ibex_block_diagram-100619_hu64d0b4d86cd0ba0563db9df884419228_38933_300x0_resize_box_2.png 2x" src=/news/2019/06/an-update-on-ibex-our-microcontroller-class-cpu-core/Ibex_block_diagram-100619_hu64d0b4d86cd0ba0563db9df884419228_38933_150x0_resize_box_2.png></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/news/2019/06/introducing-pirmin-laura/>Introducing Pirmin &amp; Laura</a></h2><h5><time>June 3, 2019</time></h5><p class=text-justify>Pirmin Vogel and Laura James both joined lowRISC on May 1st this year.
