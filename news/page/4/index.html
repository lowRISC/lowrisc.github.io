They’ve both taken some time to share a little about what they’re doing at lowRISC and what motivated them to join.
Greg &ldquo;It’s an exciting time to join the lowRISC team! Our Ibex core provides a solid foundation and clearly demonstrates the value of open source silicon, which I’m excited to be working on. My work so far has focused on the performance of Ibex; whilst it’s not intended as a high performance core there are various things we can do to improve it without major impact to area or power.</p><p><a href=/news/2019/10/introducing-greg-tom/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/news/2019/10/ibex-on-fpga-get-stuff-executed/>Ibex on FPGA - Get stuff executed</a></h2><h5><time>October 8, 2019</time></h5><p class=text-justify>Our microcontroller-class RISC-V processor core Ibex for sure is a solid base with which to start your own project. Over the past months, we have invested a lot of effort in making the design more mature. This includes refactoring the RTL to make the design more understandable and programmer friendly, adding UVM-based verification to the source tree, but also integrating support for the RISC-V compliance suite and enabling publicly visible, open-source powered continuous integration (CI) to keep the design stable.</p><p><a href=/news/2019/10/ibex-on-fpga-get-stuff-executed/>Read More…</a></p></div><img class="align-self-center rounded ml-3 d-none d-md-block" alt="Ibex on the Nexys Video FPGA board" title="Ibex on the Nexys Video FPGA board" srcset="/news/2019/10/ibex-on-fpga-get-stuff-executed/Ibex_on_Nexys_Video_hu5fbae55c836a968bbd3582778db090ca_97378_150x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 1x, /news/2019/10/ibex-on-fpga-get-stuff-executed/Ibex_on_Nexys_Video_hu5fbae55c836a968bbd3582778db090ca_97378_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 2x" src=/news/2019/10/ibex-on-fpga-get-stuff-executed/Ibex_on_Nexys_Video_hu5fbae55c836a968bbd3582778db090ca_97378_150x0_resize_q75_box.jpg></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/news/2019/08/ibex-code-with-confidence/>Ibex: Code with Confidence</a></h2><h5><time>August 23, 2019</time></h5><p class=text-justify>Ibex, our small RISC-V core, is constantly changing. Roughly 50 percent of the RTL was refactored recently! We added features, tests, and cleaned the code up. We and our collaborators were able to make these changes (mostly) without breaking Ibex because we invested in testing: earlier this year we added UVM-based verification to the tree, and we run these tests after every change. We run static code analysis to catch common programming bugs.</p><p><a href=/news/2019/08/ibex-code-with-confidence/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/news/2019/07/six-more-weeks-of-ibex-development-whats-new/>Six more weeks of Ibex development - what&#39;s new?</a></h2><h5><time>July 19, 2019</time></h5><p class=text-justify>In the past months, we have invested considerable effort in improving our RISC-V core Ibex. This 2-stage, in-order, 32-bit microcontroller-class CPU core was contributed to us by ETH Zürich in December 2018, with activity really ramping up since May. Having been taped out multiple times (as zero-riscy) in a mix of academic and industry projects, it came to us as a relatively mature code base. Despite this, we have continued to invest in improving its design and maintainability.</p><p><a href=/news/2019/07/six-more-weeks-of-ibex-development-whats-new/>Read More…</a></p></div><img class="align-self-center rounded ml-3 d-none d-md-block" alt="Ibex cleaning up" title="Ibex cleaning up" srcset="/news/2019/07/six-more-weeks-of-ibex-development-whats-new/ibex-cleaning-up_hu65694cd5eb21359ed9b68530746cc697_213355_150x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 1x, /news/2019/07/six-more-weeks-of-ibex-development-whats-new/ibex-cleaning-up_hu65694cd5eb21359ed9b68530746cc697_213355_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 2x" src=/news/2019/07/six-more-weeks-of-ibex-development-whats-new/ibex-cleaning-up_hu65694cd5eb21359ed9b68530746cc697_213355_150x0_resize_q75_box.jpg></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/news/2019/07/large-scale-risc-v-llvm-testing-with-buildroot/>Large-scale RISC-V LLVM testing with Buildroot</a></h2><h5><time>July 10, 2019</time></h5><p class=text-justify>A few years ago lowRISC started developing a new LLVM backend targeting RISC-V. Rather than copying and modifying an existing backend, in an ad hoc fashion, we started from scratch and proceeded systematically. This approach proved successful in producing a high-quality codebase. We recently announced on the llvm-dev mailing list that the backend is now reaching stability and could be promoted from its current status of experimental to an official target.</p><p><a href=/news/2019/07/large-scale-risc-v-llvm-testing-with-buildroot/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/news/2019/07/risc-v-llvm-backend-in-clang-llvm-9.0/>The RISC-V LLVM backend in Clang/LLVM 9.0</a></h2><h5><time>July 10, 2019</time></h5><p class=text-justify>On Monday I proposed promoting the upstream RISC-V LLVM backend from &ldquo;experimental&rdquo; to &ldquo;official&rdquo; for the LLVM 9.0 release. Responses so far are extremely positive, and we&rsquo;re working to ensure this is a smooth process. This means that from 9.0, the RISC-V backend will be built by default for LLVM, making it usable out of the box for standard LLVM/Clang builds. As well as being more convenient for end users, this also makes it significantly easier for e.</p><p><a href=/news/2019/07/risc-v-llvm-backend-in-clang-llvm-9.0/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/news/2019/07/introducing-sam/>Introducing Sam</a></h2><h5><time>July 8, 2019</time></h5><p class=text-justify>On June 1st, Sam Elliott followed Laura and Pirmin in becoming lowRISC’s newest employee.
