Roughly 50 percent of the RTL was refactored recently! We added features, tests, and cleaned the code up. We and our collaborators were able to make these changes (mostly) without breaking Ibex because we invested in testing: earlier this year we added UVM-based verification to the tree, and we run these tests after every change. We run static code analysis to catch common programming bugs.</p><p><a href=/blog/2019/08/ibex-code-with-confidence/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/blog/2019/07/six-more-weeks-of-ibex-development-whats-new/>Six more weeks of Ibex development - what&#39;s new?</a></h2><p class=text-justify>In the past months, we have invested considerable effort in improving our RISC-V core Ibex. This 2-stage, in-order, 32-bit microcontroller-class CPU core was contributed to us by ETH Zürich in December 2018, with activity really ramping up since May. Having been taped out multiple times (as zero-riscy) in a mix of academic and industry projects, it came to us as a relatively mature code base. Despite this, we have continued to invest in improving its design and maintainability.</p><p><a href=/blog/2019/07/six-more-weeks-of-ibex-development-whats-new/>Read More…</a></p></div><img class="align-self-center rounded ml-3 d-none d-md-block" alt="Ibex cleaning up" title="Ibex cleaning up" srcset="/blog/2019/07/six-more-weeks-of-ibex-development-whats-new/ibex-cleaning-up_hu65694cd5eb21359ed9b68530746cc697_213355_150x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 1x, /blog/2019/07/six-more-weeks-of-ibex-development-whats-new/ibex-cleaning-up_hu65694cd5eb21359ed9b68530746cc697_213355_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 2x" src=/blog/2019/07/six-more-weeks-of-ibex-development-whats-new/ibex-cleaning-up_hu65694cd5eb21359ed9b68530746cc697_213355_150x0_resize_q75_box.jpg></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/blog/2019/07/large-scale-risc-v-llvm-testing-with-buildroot/>Large-scale RISC-V LLVM testing with Buildroot</a></h2><p class=text-justify>A few years ago lowRISC started developing a new LLVM backend targeting RISC-V. Rather than copying and modifying an existing backend, in an ad hoc fashion, we started from scratch and proceeded systematically. This approach proved successful in producing a high-quality codebase. We recently announced on the llvm-dev mailing list that the backend is now reaching stability and could be promoted from its current status of experimental to an official target.</p><p><a href=/blog/2019/07/large-scale-risc-v-llvm-testing-with-buildroot/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/blog/2019/07/risc-v-llvm-backend-in-clang-llvm-9.0/>The RISC-V LLVM backend in Clang/LLVM 9.0</a></h2><p class=text-justify>On Monday I proposed promoting the upstream RISC-V LLVM backend from &ldquo;experimental&rdquo; to &ldquo;official&rdquo; for the LLVM 9.0 release. Responses so far are extremely positive, and we&rsquo;re working to ensure this is a smooth process. This means that from 9.0, the RISC-V backend will be built by default for LLVM, making it usable out of the box for standard LLVM/Clang builds. As well as being more convenient for end users, this also makes it significantly easier for e.</p><p><a href=/blog/2019/07/risc-v-llvm-backend-in-clang-llvm-9.0/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/blog/2019/07/introducing-sam/>Introducing Sam</a></h2><p class=text-justify>On June 1st, Sam Elliott followed Laura and Pirmin in becoming lowRISC’s newest employee.

Could we create a more future-proof chip by embedding an FPGA fabric into it? Could we measure glucose levels more accurately by integrating a small bio lab onto a chip?

In implementation, this dream becomes a piece of hardware, with digital or analog logic, sensors, actuators, and much more.</p><p><a href=/blog/2019/06/an-update-on-ibex-our-microcontroller-class-cpu-core/>Read More…</a></p></div><img class="align-self-center rounded ml-3 d-none d-md-block" alt="Ibex block diagram" title="Ibex block diagram" srcset="/blog/2019/06/an-update-on-ibex-our-microcontroller-class-cpu-core/Ibex_block_diagram-100619_hu64d0b4d86cd0ba0563db9df884419228_38933_150x0_resize_box_2.png 1x, /blog/2019/06/an-update-on-ibex-our-microcontroller-class-cpu-core/Ibex_block_diagram-100619_hu64d0b4d86cd0ba0563db9df884419228_38933_300x0_resize_box_2.png 2x" src=/blog/2019/06/an-update-on-ibex-our-microcontroller-class-cpu-core/Ibex_block_diagram-100619_hu64d0b4d86cd0ba0563db9df884419228_38933_150x0_resize_box_2.png></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/blog/2019/06/introducing-pirmin-laura/>Introducing Pirmin &amp; Laura</a></h2><p class=text-justify>Pirmin Vogel and Laura James both joined lowRISC on May 1st this year.
