Work on making open source hardware a reality</h1><address class=lr-blog-author><time>September 18, 2017</time></address><p>We are looking for a talented hardware engineer to join the lowRISC team and
help make our vision for an open source, secure, and flexible SoC a reality.
<a href=https://lowrisc.workable.com/j/DBAC61322F>Apply now</a>!</p><p>lowRISC C.I.C. is a not-for-profit company that aims to demonstrate, promote
and support the use of open-source hardware. The lowRISC project was
established in 2014 with the aim of bringing the benefits of open-source to
the hardware world. It is working to do this by producing a high quality,
secure, open, and flexible System-on-Chip (SoC) platform. lowRISC C.I.C. also
provides hardware and software services to support the growing RISC-V
ecosystem. Our expertise includes the LLVM Compiler, hardware security
extensions and RISC-V tools, hardware and processor design.</p><p>The successful candidate will be interested in computer architecture and
hardware design. The primary focus of the role will be the development of the
lowRISC SoC platform, which will involve work to evaluate and extend our
current design including our general-purpose tagged-memory system. lowRISC is
an ambitious project with a small core team, so you will be heavily involved
in the project&rsquo;s development direction. This role will involve frequent work
with external contributors and collaborators. While much of the work will be
at the hardware level the post will offer experience of the full
hardware/software stack, higher-level simulation tools and architectural
design issues.</p><p>Some practical experience of hardware design with a HDL such as
Verilog/SystemVerilog is essential, as is a good knowledge of the HW/SW stack.
Ideally, candidates will also have experience or demonstrated interest in some
of: SoC design, large-scale open source development, hardware or software
security, technical documentation, board support package development and
driver development. Industrial experience and higher degree levels are valued,
but we would be happy to consider an enthusiastic recent graduate with a
strong academic record.</p><p>Informal enquires should be made to Alex Bradbury <a href=mailto:asb@lowrisc.org>asb@lowrisc.org</a>.</p></article></div></main><footer class=lr-footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-2 d-none d-lg-block"><img src=/img/logo/logo-dualcolor.svg width=150px></div><div class=col><p><small>The text content on this website is licensed under a <a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>, except where otherwise noted.
