zeroRISC is a startup focused on providing a cloud security service for silicon that delivers transparency and trustworthiness for data centers and ICS/OT, IoT and edge devices.
The company played a key role in accomplishing the first OpenTitan tapeout and is driving efforts to validate the first discrete chip and bring the device to commercial production.</p><p>Founded in April 2023, zeroRISC was established by top contributors and original project founders from Google and recently <a href=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231027911768/en/zeroRISC-Launches-with-5-Million-in-Seed-Funding-to-Deliver-First-Commercial-OpenTitan%C2%AE-based-Cloud-Security-Service-for-Silicon>announced $5 million in seed funding</a> led by Cambridge Angels, a leading network of U.K. angel investors.
The funding will be used to deliver the first commercial all-in-one drop-in silicon, software and services solution built on the OpenTitan open-source silicon root of trust (RoT) project.</p><p>&ldquo;Our formal membership in the OpenTitan project marks a significant stride towards making open secure silicon a reality,&rdquo; said Dominic Rizzo, founder and CEO of zeroRISC.
&ldquo;At zeroRISC, we firmly believe that the safest and most secure systems will come to rely on open secure silicon, with trust and assurance built upon OpenTitan&rsquo;s transparent foundations.
We look forward to continuing to work together with all project partners to commercialize the first truly open-source RoT chips, a remarkable achievement for zeroRISC and a powerful testament to the success of the OpenTitan project.&rdquo;</p><p>OpenTitan&rsquo;s objective is a fundamental change in expectations of transparency for the silicon RoT design: in the same way a silicon RoT is foundational to building secure systems, transparency is foundational to the trustworthiness of that RoT.
As the first open-source RoT, OpenTitan has democratized access to a critical component of silicon security aligned with Secure by Design and Secure by Default principles.</p><p>As OpenTitan’s non-profit host, lowRISC provides essential open-source governance, technical contributions, and structural support services for all partners.
The innovative, open and collaborative methodology developed for the project – the Silicon Commons – has enabled OpenTitan to concretely demonstrate the viability of open-source chip design on par with open-source software.
It has empowered diverse partners, including Winbond, Nuvoton, Seagate, Western Digital, Google, and Rivos — and now zeroRISC — to effectively collaborate and bring a critical security technology to the cusp of commercial availability.</p><p>&ldquo;As OpenTitan matures and continues to hit its major implementation milestones, we are excited to welcome partners like zeroRISC, with their wealth of open-source silicon experience, skills and vision to the project,&rdquo; said Ilia Stolov, General Manager of Winbond Israel.
&ldquo;A truly trustworthy RoT is a critical technology, especially as the regulatory environment continues to shift in favor of certifiably secure solutions for the entire silicon supply chain.&rdquo;</p><p>OpenTitan&rsquo;s consistent emphasis on high quality <a href=https://opentitan.org/book/hw/top_earlgrey/doc/specification.html>design</a>, <a href=https://opentitan.org/dashboard/index.html>verification</a> and <a href=https://opentitan.org/book/doc/introduction.html>documentation</a> collateral puts it at the vanguard of commercially relevant open-source silicon.
Its adherence to Kerckhoff&rsquo;s principle stands in sharp contrast to closed RoT implementations, and represents a necessary reset of expectations of transparency in trustworthy, secure silicon.</p><p>To learn more about zeroRISC and its involvement in the OpenTitan project, visit: <a href=https://zerorisc.com/>https://zerorisc.com/</a>.</p><h3 id=about-lowrisc:cfee0144f493d0a1f6ba8e7e916bd911>About lowRISC</h3><p>Founded in 2014 at the University of Cambridge Computer Lab, lowRISC is a not-for-profit company/CIC that provides a neutral home for collaborative engineering to develop and maintain open source silicon designs and tools for the long term.
The lowRISC not-for-profit structure combined with full stack engineering capabilities in-house enables lowRISC to manage high quality projects like OpenTitan.</p><h3 id=about-zerorisc:cfee0144f493d0a1f6ba8e7e916bd911>About zeroRISC</h3><p>Built on the OpenTitan open-source silicon root of trust project, zeroRISC is the first commercial cloud security service for silicon that delivers transparency and trustworthiness for data centers and ICS/OT, IoT and edge devices.
The zeroRISC platform is the only all-in-one drop-in silicon, software and services solution that delivers trustworthy, cloud-based secure device management below the operating system, while making secure ownership transfer straightforward.
Headquartered in Boston, MA, zeroRISC is backed by Cambridge Angels and is a member of the OpenTitan project.
