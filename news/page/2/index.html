The first engineering samples should be in our hands before the end of the year.
OpenTitan&rsquo;s mission is to provide a secure root of trust, which is complemented by a secure processor core. To address this need, we elevated one of the most widely deployed, highest quality RISC-V cores in academia to the industrial-level of quality characteristic of this project.</p><p><a href=/news/2023/07/ibex-inside-how-and-why-we-built-opentitans-risc-v-core/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/news/2023/06/opentitans-rtl-freeze-leveraging-transparency-to-create-trustworthy-computing/>OpenTitan’s RTL Freeze - Leveraging Transparency to Create Trustworthy Computing</a></h2><h5><time>June 16, 2023</time></h5><p class=text-justify>We are delighted to announce an important development for OpenTitan®: RTL Freeze for the Earl Grey discrete, the first OpenTitan chip tapeout. This milestone is a source of immense pride for lowRISC and our OpenTitan partners, because it’s a concrete demonstration of the success of the Silicon Commons™ approach to making silicon radically more transparent and trustworthy.
In partnership with Nuvoton, a major TPM vendor, this RTL freeze means that the OpenTitan coalition will have engineering samples of the discrete silicon root of trust (RoT) this calendar year.</p><p><a href=/news/2023/06/opentitans-rtl-freeze-leveraging-transparency-to-create-trustworthy-computing/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/news/2023/04/a-major-milestone-for-opentitan/>A Major Milestone for OpenTitan</a></h2><h5><time>April 20, 2023</time></h5><p class=text-justify>We are excited to announce today that the OpenTitan project has hit a major tapeout milestone: a feature freeze of its open-source RTL.
Together with our partners, we began the OpenTitan project in 2019 with the goal of producing the world’s first open-source silicon Root of Trust (RoT). With this new achievement we are a step closer to realising that goal.
Getting to this point has taken a lot of coordinated work, as we&rsquo;ve had to navigate the many stumbling blocks that have traditionally made open-source silicon development a challenge.</p><p><a href=/news/2023/04/a-major-milestone-for-opentitan/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/news/2022/12/lowrisc-wins-openuk-2022-awards-hardware-category/>lowRISC wins OpenUK 2022 Awards Hardware Category</a></h2><h5><time>December 2, 2022</time></h5><p class=text-justify>We are thrilled to have been selected as the winner of the OpenUK 2022 Awards Hardware Category and would like to thank OpenUK, the award sponsors StackPublishing, the judges and all our hard working staff at lowRISC without whom this would not be possible.</p><p><a href=/news/2022/12/lowrisc-wins-openuk-2022-awards-hardware-category/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/news/2022/10/introducing-the-foundation-of-true-security/>Introducing the Foundation of True Security - the Silicon Root of Trust</a></h2><h5><time>October 31, 2022</time></h5><p class=text-justify>Recent headlines about ransomware attacks, account phishing, and identity theft continue to underscore the critical importance of cybersecurity in our everyday lives. This has led to a growing awareness among most businesses and households of important mitigations like encryption, 2-factor authentication and verified software updates. But guess what? There&rsquo;s an unsung hero behind all these safeguards that underpins their effectiveness: the silicon Root of Trust (RoT).
And yet, despite the vital role these RoTs play, few people, including even security professionals, are familiar with what a Root of Trust is — or in fact that it even exists.</p><p><a href=/news/2022/10/introducing-the-foundation-of-true-security/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/news/2022/10/claudia-eckert-joins-board/>lowRISC Appoints Cybersecurity Expert Prof. Dr. Claudia Eckert to Board of Directors</a></h2><h5><time>October 5, 2022</time></h5><p class=text-justify>CAMBRIDGE, United Kingdom, Oct. 5th, 2022 – lowRISC C.I.C., the open source system on a chip (SoC) organization, today announced the appointment of Prof. Dr. Claudia Eckert to its board of directors.
Eckert holds the chair for IT Security in the Department of Computer Science at Technical University of Munich (TUM) and is director of the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied and Integrated Security (AISEC) in Munich, overseeing more than 220 researchers.</p><p><a href=/news/2022/10/claudia-eckert-joins-board/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/news/2022/08/security-verification-of-an-open-source-hardware-root-of-trust/>Security Verification of an Open Source Hardware Root of Trust</a></h2><h5><time>August 3, 2022</time></h5><p class=text-justify>OpenTitan is a powerful open source silicon root of trust project, designed from scratch as a transparent, trustworthy and secure implementation for enterprises, platform providers and chip manufacturers.
