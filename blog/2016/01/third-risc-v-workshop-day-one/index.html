<p>The <a href="https://riscv.org/2015/12/prelim-agenda-3rd-risc-v-workshop/">third RISC-V workshop</a> is going
on today and tomorrow at the Oracle Conference Center, California. I&rsquo;ll be
keeping a semi-live blog of talks and announcements throughout the day. See
<a href="https://www.lowrisc.org/blog/2016/01/third-risc-v-workshop-day-two">here</a> for
notes from the second day.</p>

<h2 id="introductions-and-risc-v-foundation-overview-rick-o-connor:6ba2032c06bf883b3d2851c8414b058c">Introductions and RISC-V Foundation Overview: Rick O&rsquo;Connor</h2>

<ul>
<li>Save the date, the 4th RISC-V workshop will be July 12th-13th at the MIT
CSAIL/Stata Center.</li>
<li>In August 2015, articles of incorporation were filed to create a non-profit
RISC-V Foundation to govern the ISA.</li>
<li>RISC-V Foundation mission statement: The RISC-V Foundation is a non-profit
consortium chartered to standardize, protect, and promote the free and open
RISC-V instruction set architecture together with its hardware and software
ecosystem for use in all computing devices.</li>
<li>The RISC-V ISA and related standards shall remain open and license-free to
all parties.</li>
<li>The compatibility test suites shall always be publicly available as a source
code download.</li>
<li>To protect the standard, only members (with commercial RISC-V products) of
the Foundation in good standing can use &ldquo;RISC-V&rdquo; and associated trademarks,
and only for devices that pass the tests in the open-source compatibility
suites maintained by the Foundation.</li>
<li>Drafting a new license for the ISA &lsquo;combining the best of BSD, GPL and so
on&rsquo;.</li>
<li>The Foundation will have a board of 7 directors elected by the members. All
members of committees must be members of the RISC-V Foundation.</li>
<li>All details of the foundation are a work in progress. Feedback is welcome!</li>
<li>16 member companies so far. Bluespec, Draper, Google, Hewlett Packard Labs,
Microsemi, Oracle, SiFive, antmicro, codasip, Gray Research, Lattice
Semiconductor, lowRISC, ROA logic, Rumble Development, Syntacore, Technolution</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="risc-v-updates-krste-asanovic:6ba2032c06bf883b3d2851c8414b058c">RISC-V Updates: Krste Asanovic</h2>

<ul>
<li>The 1.9 version of the compressed extension is on track to become frozen and
become blessed as v2.0. Now is the time to speak up if you have any feedback
or concerns!</li>
<li>Privileged architecture 1.7 was released in May 2015 and has received a lot
of feedback. Hope to release an updated draft addressing feedback in the next
month or two. Doubt it will really settle down before the summer, as it needs
more OS and driver development against it.</li>
<li>&lsquo;V&rsquo; Vector Extension: not yet ready to release a draft for this workshop,
but the RTL of the HWacha vector coprocessor has been open-sourced along with
3 tech-reports.</li>
<li>Hwacha is NOT the V extensions. It&rsquo;s a research project designed to push the
limits of in-order decoupled data-parallel accelerators (e.g. GPUs). The
microarchitecture does demonstrate some of the ideas that will appear in V.</li>
<li>Ongoing ISA research at UCB: virtual local store (VLS, Henry Cook&rsquo;s 2009
master&rsquo;s thesis) and user-level DMA (copying data between DRAM and VLS
directly).</li>
<li>New Berkeley open-source cores: BOOM out-of-order implementation and V-Scale
(verilog implementation of Z-Scale).</li>
<li>RISC-V is being transitioned out of Berkeley. This involves upstreaming of
tools and the RISC-V Foundation taking over the standards process.</li>
<li>SiFive has been founded by some of the lead RISC-V developers (Krste
Asanovic, Yunsup Lee, Andrew Waterman). Sutter Hill Ventures have invested.</li>
<li>Most urgent outstanding issues: holes and ambiguities in the specification
and the platform specification.</li>
<li>Holes in the spec: floating-point NaNs (resolved and updated), CSR
read/write semantics (resolved, updated spec), memory model (far from
resolved), Hypervisor support (no proposal). A formal spec of the whole ISA
and memory model is desired.</li>
<li>Although RISC-V was designed in reusable layers, some concrete standards for
hardware platforms are desirable e.g. memory maps, interrupt controller, power
management. To what extent can platform specs be shared across
microcontroller-class, application cores, and rack-scale designs?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="risc-v-external-debug-aka-jtag-debugging-tim-newsome:6ba2032c06bf883b3d2851c8414b058c">RISC-V External Debug (aka JTAG debugging): Tim Newsome</h2>

<ul>
<li>Goals: a debug system that works for everybody with a working system done by
July 1st 2016.</li>
<li>The specification will be submitted to the RISC-V Foundation and there are
plans for an open source release of the debugger and implementations for
Rocket and Z-Scale.</li>
<li>Status: the specification is mostly complete.</li>
<li>Features: (many, see the slides). Interested in tracing core execution to on
or off-chip RAM and providing a framework to debug any component on the
system, not just the RISC-V cores.</li>
<li>The debug transport module provides access to the system bus. It implements
a message queue and optional authentication.</li>
<li>New CSRs will be added and exposed on the system bus.</li>
<li>The spec describes a small amount of debug memory (1KiB ROM) and 8-16 bytes
of RAM. This memory is not cached and is shared between all cores.</li>
<li>Up to 4095 hardware breakpoints supported (but 4 is more typical). Each may
support exact address match, address range match, exact data match, data range
match, &hellip;</li>
<li>The work-in-progress spec will be posted to the hw-dev RISC-V mailing list
later today. Comments very welcome.</li>
<li>Question: how does this map to gdb&rsquo;s capabilities? Are there things it can
do but gdb can&rsquo;t or vice-versa? It&rsquo;s not a 1:1 match but should be a superset
of what gdb can do.</li>
<li>Question: how does the tracing scale? Hasn&rsquo;t be investigated yet.</li>
<li>Question: will support be integrated into the BOOM codebase? Answer: not
currently planned.</li>
<li>Question: there&rsquo;s a wide spectrum of functionality that different
implementations could implement. Is there a discovery mechanism for the
functionality that is supported? Yes.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="risc-v-in-axiom-michael-gielda:6ba2032c06bf883b3d2851c8414b058c">RISC-V in Axiom: Michael Gielda</h2>

<ul>
<li>Axiom is a fully open source 4K film camera design. It is an EU Horizon 2020
project with multiple partners.</li>
<li>Aim of Axiom is to create an extensible open source platform that is also a
desirable project in itself. The aim is to open up what is currently a fairly
closed industry and lower barriers of entry to new players. There is an
obvious parallel to the RISC-V and lowRISC projects.</li>
<li>Chose the largest Zynq FPGA that had zero-cost tool support to maximise the
number of people who can hack on the design.</li>
<li>Using the Z-Scale as a soft-core for communication between the FPGA
pre-processing board (Kintex-7) and the FPGA SoC main board with a dual-core
Cortex-A9 (Zynq 7030).</li>
<li>Long-term goals are to ensure the design can be reused through
parameterisation, and look at broadening adoption of the Chisel design
methodology.</li>
<li>The Axiom Gamma project is almost half-way done. There will be an EU
technical review in March at which point it should be working.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="emulating-future-hpc-soc-architectures-using-risc-v-farzad-fatollahi-fard:6ba2032c06bf883b3d2851c8414b058c">Emulating future HPC SoC architectures using RISC-V: Farzad Fatollahi-Fard</h2>

<ul>
<li>Should HPC take inspiration from the embedded market?</li>
<li>Is building an SoC for HPC a good idea? HPC is power limited
(performance/Watt) which arguably means HPC and embedded requirements are
aligned.</li>
<li>From a previous project case study (Green Wave), they found an embedded SoC
design was performance/power competitive with Fermi. This had a 12x12 2D
on-chip torus network with 676 compute cores, 33 supervisor cores, 1 PCI
express interface, 8 Hybrid Memory Cube interfaces, &hellip;</li>
<li>Proposed an FPGA-implemented SoC for HPC. This contains 4 Z-scale processors
with a 2x2 concentrated mesh with 2 virtual channels. The Z-Scale was chosen
for area-efficiency on FPGA.</li>
<li>The network is implemented using the <a href="https://github.com/LBL-CoDEx/OpenSoCFabric">OpenSoC
fabric</a> (open source and in
chisel). AHB endpoints have now beed added and AXI is in-development.</li>
<li>A 96-core system was constructed using multiple FPGAs.</li>
<li>For more info, see <a href="http://www.codexhpc.org/">CoDEx HPC</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="grvi-phalanx-a-massively-parallel-risc-v-fpga-accelerator-jan-gray:6ba2032c06bf883b3d2851c8414b058c">GRVI Phalanx. A massively parallel RISC-V FPGA accelerator: Jan Gray</h2>

<ul>
<li>GRVI is pronounced &lsquo;groovy&rsquo;.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s lots of interest in FPGA accelerators right now (Altera acquisition,
MSR&rsquo;s catapult).</li>
<li>FPGAs are an interesting platform. Massively parallel. Specialized.
Connected. High throughput. Low latency. The big barrier is of course porting
your software. Jan argues OpenCL for FPGAs is a major breakthrough for this
problem, if you&rsquo;re lucky enough to have an application that can be expressed
in OpenCL.</li>
<li>Phalanx is an accelerator accelerator - an infrastructure making it easier
to run you application on an FPGA and connect everything together. It is
composed of processor+accelerator clusters+NoC.</li>
<li>Jan&rsquo;s Razor: &ldquo;In a CMP, cut inessential resources from each CPU, to maximize
CPUs per die.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Jan has achieved an RV32I datapath in about 250 LUTs. This core can achieve
300-375MHz, 1.3-1.6CPI. The &lsquo;GRVI&rsquo; core is ~320 6-LUTs so &ldquo;1 MIPS/LUT&rdquo;.</li>
<li>How many can you fit on a modern FPGA? The limiting resource is really the
block RAMs. In a cluster, two processing elements can share an instruction
BRAM, and all PEs can share a cluster memory.</li>
<li>How should the clusters be interconnected? A 5-port virtual channel router
might be a sensible choice in an ASIC, but does not map well to an FPGA.
Instead use a <a href="http://fpga.org/2015/09/03/introducing-hoplite/">Hoplite</a> 2D
router. This is only 1% of the area x delay product of FPGA-optimized VC
routers. Each cluster has a 300 bit connection to the Hoplite router (with a
256bit payload).</li>
<li>400 of the GRVI Phalanx PEs can fit on a Xilinx KU040. The amortized cost of
the router per processor is only 40 LUTs.</li>
<li>Can fit 32 GRVI Phalanx PEs on an Artix-7-35T.</li>
<li>Want to support different accelerated parallel programming models: SPMD,
MIMD, MP. All potentially accelerated by custom GRVI And cluster function
units, custom memory or interconnects, custom accelerators on the NOC.</li>
<li>Next steps: debug/trace over NoC, Hoplite/AXI4 bridges, OpenCL stack,
potential bridge to Chisel RISC-V infrastructure?</li>
<li>Question: how do I get this? Not available yet, and not yet sure on the
licensing model.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="coreboot-on-risc-v-ron-minnich:6ba2032c06bf883b3d2851c8414b058c">Coreboot on RISC-V: Ron Minnich</h2>

<ul>
<li>Initializing the stuff outside the main CPU on a chromebook takes about 1
billion instructions before it can start Linux.</li>
<li>Firmware, 1990-2005 &ldquo;fire and forget&rdquo;. Set al lthe stff kernels can&rsquo;t do
(e.g. LinuxBIOS), then get out of the way. But now there&rsquo;s a push for the
firmware to hang around after boot.</li>
<li>Ron argues this sucks. It&rsquo;s slow, there&rsquo;s no easy bugfix path, and it&rsquo;s not
SMP capable on x86.</li>
<li>Why doesn&rsquo;t Ron like persistent firmware? It&rsquo;s another attack vector,
indistinguishable from a persistent embedded threat. Ron&rsquo;s preference is the
platform management code run as a kernel thread. Minion cores are ideal for
this (Ron&rsquo;s words rather than mine - I of course agree whole-heartedly).</li>
<li>coreboot is a GPLv2 BIOS replacement (not a bootloader). It has multiple
possible payloads including SeaBIOS and depthcharge (used for verified boot on
Chromebooks).</li>
<li>Port was started in October 2014 as a side project. The effort resumed in
July 2015 with the privileged spec, and as-of September is up and running
again. The most recent port runs on Spike but not QEMU (due to lack of support
for the privileged spec).</li>
<li>RISC-V is a first class citizen in coreboot, all commits must pass tests for
the RISC-V buildbot.</li>
<li>src/arch/riscv is 2685 LoC.</li>
<li>The Federal Office for Information Security in Germany runs a hardware test
station for coreboot. As soon as real hardware is running, they&rsquo;ve offered to
integrate it into their system.</li>
<li>Lessons learned

<ul>
<li>provide a boot time SRAM (make sure the address is fixed and not aliased
by DRAM once DRAM is up).</li>
<li>Provide a serial port.</li>
<li>Ron reiterates that runtime functions belong in the kernel, not persistent
firmware.</li>
<li>Firmware tables always need translation by kernel, so make them text not
binary.</li>
<li>Keep the mask ROM as simple as possible.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t cheap out on SPI or flash part size. Just plan a 64MiB part.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t reset the chipset on IE device not present.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="risc-v-and-uefi-dong-wei-and-abner-chang:6ba2032c06bf883b3d2851c8414b058c">RISC-V and UEFI: Dong Wei and Abner Chang</h2>

<ul>
<li>There is a UEFI Forum consistent of a board of 12 directors, 12 promoters,
42 contributors, 213 adopters.</li>
<li>UEFI and ACPI are both now handled by the UEFI Forum.</li>
<li>A RISC-V UEFI port is taking place using EDKII (EFI Development Kit II) and
OVMF (Open Virtual Machine Firmware).</li>
<li>The speakers are giving a very thorough description of the UEFI boot
mechanism which I&rsquo;m not able to do justice. You&rsquo;re best waiting for the
slides+video I&rsquo;m afraid.</li>
<li>The project was started a few months ago, and can now boot to a UEFI shell.</li>
<li>They have created a new RISC-V QEMU target with some PC peripherals (CMOS,
PM, PCI and other devices), and also implemented RISC-V machine mode.</li>
<li>Requests for new RISC-V spec additions: a periodic timer CSR, RTC with alarm
CSR, PI management mode support, &hellip; (sorry, missed some).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="freebsd-and-risc-v-ruslan-bukin:6ba2032c06bf883b3d2851c8414b058c">FreeBSD and RISC-V: Ruslan Bukin</h2>

<ul>
<li>FreeBSD will support RV64I in release 11.0.</li>
<li>Why use FreeBSD? Among other reasons, it gives a full-stack BSD license
(RISC-V, FreeBSD, LLVM/Clang).</li>
<li>FreeBSD has been brought up on Spike.</li>
<li>The early boot assembly code will put the hardware in a known state, build a
ring buffer for interrupts, initialise the page tables, enable the MMU, then
finally branch to a virtual address and call into C code.</li>
<li>Userspace porting required modifications to jemalloc, csu (crt1.S, crtn.S,
crti.S), libc, msun (libm), rtld-elf (the runtime linker).</li>
<li>The FreeBSD port is based on the ARMv8 port. It has a 25k line diff and took
6 months from scratch.</li>
<li>Userland started working in December. Support will now be committed to
FreeBSD SVN.</li>
<li>Next plans include multicore, FPU, increasing the virtual address space,
DTrace, performance monitoring counters, QEMU, &hellip;</li>
<li>Proposed changes: split sptbr to sptrbr0 and sptbr1 for the user VA and the
kernel VA. This means there is no need to change SPTBR when changing the
privilege level, and should reduce code size.</li>
<li>For more on the project, see the relevant <a href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/riscv">FreeBSD wiki
page</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="building-the-risc-v-software-ecosystem-arun-thomas:6ba2032c06bf883b3d2851c8414b058c">Building the RISC-V software ecosystem: Arun Thomas</h2>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;2016 is the year of RISC-V&rdquo;. Or at least, the year of RISC-V software. We
have a great opportunity to push the software stack forwards.</li>
<li>What can we achieve by the end of the year? Hopefully upstereamed GNU
toolchain and QEMU. More mature Clang/LLVM support, upstreamed OS support,
Debian/RISC-V port, start thinking about Android and a real-time OS.</li>
<li>How do we get there? We need to recruit more RISC-V developers and make it
easier for people to get started by producing more docs and specifications.</li>
<li>Right now, the RISC-V Github has had 48 contributors from a wide range of
Universities, companies and OSS projects.</li>
<li>We should present talks and tutorials at developer conferences and local
user group meetings.</li>
<li>If you have local patches, upstream them!</li>
<li>How to attract developers? Could fund developers/projects via the
Foundation, apply to be a Google Summer of Code mentoring organization, update
the list of open bugs and future requests on github and track contribution
statistics.</li>
<li>We can make it much easier for people to get started by building Debian
packages, upstreaming, and providing regular binary snapshots.</li>
<li>Spike is great for prototyping hardware features, but QEMU is a better tool
for software development and a critical part of the RISC-V software story.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s more to specify. e.g. a platform specification (e.g. ARMv8 Server
Base System Architecture), boot architecture (look at the ARMv8 Server Base
Boot Requirements), RISC-V ABI, hypervisor, security.</li>
<li>Useful documents include a RISC-V Assembly Guide, some equivalent of the ARM
Cortex-A Programmer&rsquo;s Guide, and a New Contributor&rsquo;s Guide.</li>
