on a Nexys4DDR FPGA.</p><ul><li>You will require:</li><li>A Linux PC with sudo access with two readily accessible USB ports</li><li>(these instructions apply to Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS)</li><li>A Nexys4DDR FPGA board from Digilent with combined power and USB cable</li><li>A micro-SD card (minimum 4GBytes capacity)</li><li>A PC-compatible SD-card reader</li></ul><h2 id=choosing-a-hardware-configuration:a39c9f7aa728d5fa3b973bc6ba49228a>Choosing a hardware configuration</h2><p>lowRISC can be configured standalone, mimicking a PC, or with a remote serial console (not to be confused with the tethered option mentioned in some RISCV documentation sources). For the remote console option the FPGA configuration can come from USB memory stick, so the large (up to 28GBytes) Vivado installation is not required. For the standalone option it has to come from Quad-SPI flash memory.</p><h3 id=remote-console-requirements:a39c9f7aa728d5fa3b973bc6ba49228a>Remote console requirements</h3><ul><li>A USB memory stick if you don&rsquo;t want to use Vivado and Quad-SPI.</li><li>Install microcom or your favourite terminal emulator program (remote keyboard option only will be available)</li><li>You will need to use the following command to allow microcom to run as the non-superuser:</li><li>sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER</li></ul><h3 id=standalone-pc-free-requirements:a39c9f7aa728d5fa3b973bc6ba49228a>Standalone (PC free) requirements</h3><ul><li>A VGA compatible LCD monitor</li><li>A PS/2 style PC-AT keyboard with USB connector</li><li>A copy of Vivado 2018.1 webpack edition (with SDK if you plan to do development) to program the Quad-SPI</li></ul><h4 id=for-both-options-a-100base-t-ethernet-cable-to-a-home-hub-or-corporate-lan-is-recommended:a39c9f7aa728d5fa3b973bc6ba49228a>For both options a 100Base-T Ethernet cable to a home hub or corporate LAN is recommended.</h4><p>The quickstart Makefile should be installed as follows:</p><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/lowRISC/lowrisc-quickstart.git
cd lowrisc-quickstart
</code></pre><p>If you don&rsquo;t have git installed the following workaround may be used:</p><pre><code>wget https://github.com/lowRISC/lowrisc-quickstart/archive/master.zip
unzip master
cd lowrisc-quickstart-master
</code></pre><p>However the Makefile was obtained, proceed as follows to obtain the release files:</p><pre><code>make getrelease
</code></pre><p>Three files will be downloaded as follows:</p><ul><li>boot.bin - The Linux kernel, Berkeley boot loader, and initial cpio (ramdisk)</li><li>chip_top.bit - The FPGA bitstream containing the RISCV processor and peripherals and the first-stage booter</li><li>rootfs.tar.xz - The compressed tape archive containing the Debian root filing system for RISCV</li></ul><p>Type lsblk before and after inserting the SD-card and its adaptor into the computer. You should see new devices added, similar to the following:</p><pre><code>sdc      8:32   1  14.9G  0 disk

</code></pre><h2 id=read-this-warning:a39c9f7aa728d5fa3b973bc6ba49228a>READ THIS WARNING (!)</h2><p>The procedure below erases all data on the disk, so do not mistakenly specify your hard drive or external mass storage. Some checks will be carried out, such as skipping UUIDs found in /etc/fstab.
If your USB disk shows up as something other than sdc, you need to run the following commands with the parameter</p><pre><code>USB=whatever, where whatever is whatever your removable disk is called
</code></pre><h4 id=if-you-do-not-understand-this-do-not-proceed-get-some-help:a39c9f7aa728d5fa3b973bc6ba49228a>IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS, DO NOT PROCEED, GET SOME HELP !!!</h4><p>If you use a fresh card, only sdc1 will typically be present. If you use the recommended operating system Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS, any known partitions will be mounted and automatically shown in windows. In this case do</p><pre><code>make umount USB=sdc
</code></pre><p>otherwise, continue with</p><pre><code>make USB=sdc cleandisk partition
</code></pre><p>You may get an error, Re-reading the partition table failed.: Device or resource busy, in this case remove the card reader and reinsert it. do another make umount if necessary, and run lsblk again, You should see:</p><pre><code>sdc      8:32   1  14.9G  0 disk

└─sdc4   8:36   1  12.3G  0 part 
</code></pre><p>The new partition table defaults to: 32Mbytes for DOS partition, 2G for the root, 512M for swap, and the rest for /home. If you don&rsquo;t like these numbers they can be edited in the file cardmem.sh</p><p>The next few steps can all be executed in one go:</p><pre><code>make USB=sdc mkfs fatdisk extdisk
</code></pre><p>You will be asked to confirm if the card previously had readable data on it. The first step makes the new filing systems, the second step writes the kernel+BBL to the DOS partition, and the third step extracts the root filing system. Unmounting the disk at the end of this process can take a while due to buffering. Do not attempt to remove the card reader until the umount completes. This SD-card is ready to be inserted in the slot underneath the Digilent board near to the USB connector.</p><h2 id=remote-console-installation:a39c9f7aa728d5fa3b973bc6ba49228a>Remote console installation</h2><p>For remote installation the USB master function is not needed and may be used to contain the required bitstream. Vivado is not needed which is an advantage since it is a multi-gigabyte download. You can use the following command (all the same caveats about being very careful to choose the correct disk apply as above)</p><pre><code>make memstick USB=sdc
</code></pre><p>To use this method JP1 must be in the USB/SD position and JP2 should be in the USB position. Once configured, the USB stick is inaccessible to Linux and cannot be used to store other files. After pressing the PROG button with the USB memory stick inserted the BUSY light should glow amber steadily for 30 seconds or so, then the green DONE light will come on. In the event of failure, the amber BUSY light will flash slowly, in this case it is worth trying a different memory stick.</p><p>Configuration from SD-Card is not supported in this release (because the onboard PIC places the SD-Card in 1-bit SPI mode, and we need it in 4-bit SD mode). If a method is found to return to 4-bit SD-mode, then this mode can be supported in a future release.</p><h2 id=standalone-installation:a39c9f7aa728d5fa3b973bc6ba49228a>Standalone installation</h2><p>For standalone installation Vivado is required and the bitstream will be installed in QSPI memory. Even if you don&rsquo;t require standalone use, this method is preferred for reliability and performance. The Nexys4-DDR board should be plugged in and powered up, and the Digilent drivers should have been installed as per the manufacturer&rsquo;s recommendations.</p><pre><code>make program-cfgmem
</code></pre><p>This action will have no effect unless the programming jumper JP1 is in the QSPI position.</p><h2 id=switch-settings:a39c9f7aa728d5fa3b973bc6ba49228a>Switch settings</h2><p>In addition to setting JP1 and JP2, the DIP-SW 1 (next to LED1) should be on and the others off, unless you have more than one board booted in which case DIP-SW 15-12 should be used to set a unique MAC address.</p><h2 id=boot-log:a39c9f7aa728d5fa3b973bc6ba49228a>Boot log</h2><h3 id=this-is-the-output-from-boot-c:a39c9f7aa728d5fa3b973bc6ba49228a>This is the output from boot.c</h3><pre><code>lowRISC boot program

</code></pre><h2 id=console-behaviour:a39c9f7aa728d5fa3b973bc6ba49228a>Console behaviour</h2><p>To save providing many different binaries, lowRISC release refresh-v0.6 only provides one console choice.
This is the VT console, also known as the PC screen. This provides the best experience because error messages
are in colour and so-on. But we also need to cater for situations where this hardware is not available, so
the PC hardware driver incorporates a hook to deliver console output to the serial port also. This is adequate,
but lacks the sophistication required for full-screen editing, because the sequences send to the VT console
are very different to what a serial console requires. This is why ssh connection is recommended for
extensive use, because the users&rsquo;s preferences such as ANSI control sequences will be reflected in the type of
host connection.</p><h2 id=customising-the-installation-in-linux:a39c9f7aa728d5fa3b973bc6ba49228a>Customising the installation in Linux</h2><p>Because emulation on FPGA is rather slow compared to a modern PC, it is convenient to have a procedure
to customise the installation on a PC. This can also be used as a rescue method if the password is locked
or similar eventualities. In addition the card reader is optimised for performance and can take advantage
of higher speed modes and better signal integrity that have been introduced from time to time.</p><pre><code>make customise
dpkg-reconfigure locales
dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
apt install gnuchess
</code></pre><p>This method relies on misc binary emulation for RISCV being installed (typically in /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/qemu-riscv64)</p><h3 id=how-does-this-work:a39c9f7aa728d5fa3b973bc6ba49228a>How does this work</h3><p>RISCV executables under Linux use a posix style convention for system calls (open, read, write etc). Under FPGA emulation these map to the running RISCV kernel. Under PC qemu emulation these foreign binaries are recognised as scripts for /usr/bin/qemu-riscv64-static, which interprets the executable with just-in-time conversion and translates the system calls to regular x86-64 Linux kernel calls. This behaviour breaks down if you try to access kernel data structures that do not match, but is useful for the majority of tasks.</p><h2 id=debugging:a39c9f7aa728d5fa3b973bc6ba49228a>Debugging</h2><p>Without a doubt the quality of the debugger is the number one feature software engineers look for when choosing a processor. A primary aim of the refresh-v0.6 release is updating the technical content as much as possible (and making it easy to update further as needed). An important improvement in newer versions of Rocket has been the availability of a JTAG connection to allow gdb to be used on the running FPGA. Because the Xilinx device uses JTAG for many test and configuration purposes, it is not possible to match the instruction width and user JTAG registers from the debug specification. Only the Verilog, Chisel and openocd components are impacted by this change. The bitstream incorporated in this release has already been adjusted for this purpose (at the moment this also prevents Vivado internal logic analyser from working). The modified version of openocd may be compiled as follows:</p><pre><code>make debug
</code></pre><p>The patched version of openocd will be downloaded, built and launched. You should say output that eventually ends with:</p><pre><code>openocd -f openocd-nexys4ddr.cfg
