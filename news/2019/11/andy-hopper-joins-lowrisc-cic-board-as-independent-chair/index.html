Hopper</a>, CBE FRS FIET FREng, has joined the
lowRISC Board of Directors as Independent Chair.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m delighted to be joining lowRISC CIC,&rdquo; said Prof. Hopper, speaking today
from Cambridge UK, &ldquo;As digital systems pervade every aspect of our lives trust
and transparency become crucial. An open source approach allows for public
inspection of the principles and implementations being used. I believe the
future of digital systems will be underpinned by not for profit organisations
that provide design transparency and enable real innovation. I am putting all
my weight behind lowRISC because it is an indispensable component of our
digital world.&rdquo;</p><p>Professor Hopper, Treasurer and Vice-President of the Royal Society and
Professor of Computer Technology at the University of Cambridge, is a pivotal
figure in the UK technology scene. He was the Research Director of Acorn
Computers from 1979-85, during which period the pioneering ARM1 RISC processor
was developed<sup>1</sup>, and headed up the world-renowned Cambridge
University Computer Lab between 2004 and 2018.</p><p>Cited as one of the <a href=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/cn/news/the-uks-100-leading-practising-scientists/2010580.article>UK&rsquo;s leading practicing
scientists</a>,
Professor Hopper also has deep connections within the business community,
having co-founded thirteen spin-outs and start-ups, three of which have
subsequently been taken public. In recent years, the companies he helped
create have
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Awards_for_Enterprise>received five Queen&rsquo;s Awards for Enterprise</a>.</p><p>The lowRISC board looks forward to working with Professor Hopper to grow
lowRISC CIC&rsquo;s engineering and executive team, deepen our relationships with
new and existing partners like Google, and maximize the positive global impact
of open source silicon design in a variety of high value target applications.</p><p><sup>1</sup> ARM itself was subsequently spun out in 1990.</p><hr><p><em>Dr Robert Mullins, lowRISC Director and Co-Founder</em></p></article></div></main><footer class=lr-footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-2 d-none d-lg-block"><img src=/img/logo/logo-dualcolor.svg width=150px></div><div class=col><p><small>The text content on this website is licensed under a <a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>, except where otherwise noted.
