universties. Largest outside of Silicon Valley.</li><li>Rick gives the usual overview of the RISC-V Foundation structure.</li><li>The RISC-V Foundation currently has over 150 members, including invidual
members. These members are distributed across 25 countries around the world.</li></ul><h2 id=risc-v-state-of-the-union-krste-asanovic:2362d622cd60bdb9d5eb8a1222aae504>RISC-V state of the union: Krste Asanovic</h2><ul><li>Krste gives an overview of the RISC-V ISA for newcomers.</li><li>RISC-V encoding terminology.<ul><li>Standard: defined by the Foundation</li><li>Reserved: Foundation might eventually use this space for future standard
extensions.</li><li>Custom: Space for impelmenter-specific extensions, never claimed by
Foundation.</li></ul></li><li>The RISC-V big tent philosophy: enable all types of RISC-V implementation,
from 32-bit microcontrollers with 1KiB SRAM up to 64-bit Unix servers with
virtualisation or 128-bit 100k-core supercomputer with PiBs DRAM, open or
proprietary business models, non-conforming extensions, software
implementations (e.g. QEMU), &hellip;<ul><li>Minimize wasted work through maximum reuse. Factor out platform-level
requirements from reusable ISA and software modules</li><li>Use standard platform profiles to reduce ecosystem effort.</li></ul></li><li>A system is minimally RISC-V-ISA-compliant if it runs claimed RISC-V
unprivileged code correctly. e.g. gcc-compiled RV32IMAC functions work
correctly. Platform must support loading program, returning result etc.</li><li>One set of unprivileged ISA compliance tests should be able to run on any
platform. There is a challenge here in handling tiny platforms, e.g. 1KiB
SRAM.</li><li>A platform specification provides tight constraints on system configuration
and options to support a software ecosystem.<ul><li>It provides an interface between platform hardware and software, including
privileged levels.</li><li>Avoid unnecessary duplication. Where it&rsquo;s possible to define a common
standard, do so.</li><li>Platform compliance tests will be built in collaboration with the relevant
ecosystem. e.g. server platform compliance, ZephyrOS platform compliance.</li></ul></li><li>Software is king in the RISC-V land<ul><li>ISA extensions need compiler/linker/library support</li><li>There&rsquo;s no point adding instructions if no software wants to use it.</li><li>ISA proposals should be sensible to implement.</li><li>Finished now is better than perfect sometime. But at the same time,
shouldn&rsquo;t rush to freeze a spec before it&rsquo;s ready.</li></ul></li><li>Open-source hardware vs software<ul><li>Some lessons from the free/open source software community apply, but many
things are different. e.g. very large investments in hardware that cannot be
changed once manufactured, threat of patent lawsuits</li></ul></li><li>Major milestones in 2017<ul><li>Fixed holes in user ISA, no changed now in IMAFDQC</li><li>Froze priv-1.10 spec. Updates must be backwards compatible</li><li>Memory model work</li><li>Linux ABI frozen</li><li>Debug spec completed</li></ul></li><li>2018 initiatives<ul><li>Working to prepare the base ISA for ratifications</li><li>Formal spec in progress</li><li>Hypervisor spec done, need implementations</li><li>Crypto in progress</li><li>J (dynamic translation / runtimes) in progress</li><li>Packed SIMD in progress</li><li>Security task group ongoing</li><li>Fast interrupts started</li><li>Trace started</li><li>Krste comments it may take longer to finish these things vs comparable
industry projects. Have many more stakeholders giving input.</li></ul></li><li>2018 embedded platform<ul><li>New ABI for embedded (e.g. long double = 64bit)</li><li>Build on RV32E</li><li>compiler/library work for improved code compression</li></ul></li><li>RISC-V and security<ul><li>Set up security standing committee. Chaired by Helena Handschuh (Rambus),
vice-chair Joe Kiniry (Galois Research).</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=the-state-of-risc-v-software-palmer-dabbelt:2362d622cd60bdb9d5eb8a1222aae504>The state of RISC-V software: Palmer Dabbelt</h2><ul><li>Palmer shows a picture of Xorg with web browser, terminal, webcam, and a 3d
video game all running on a RISC-V core (SiFive Unleashed with Microsemi
add-on board).</li><li>GNU-based toolchains<ul><li>binutils, gcc, glibc, newlib all upstreamed.</li></ul></li><li>The RISC-V Linux kernel port was upstreamed in January 2018. It only
supports RV64I systems for now, and is currently missing some platform
drivers. Help would be welcomed in getting these upstream.</li><li>RISC-V Fedora and Debian support is in progress</li><li>RISC-V LLVM port is making rapid progress. RV32IMFDC upstream. [As a
correction to the talk, compressed support is upstream - thanks to
contributions from Andes Tech and Qualcomm!]</li><li>Bootloaders: U-boot is upstream, TianoCore is a work in progress. Coreboot
RISC-V support is upstream but a little out of date. UEFI standard process is
ongoing.</li><li>Embedded runtimes: Zephry is upstream, seL4 upstream, FreeRTOS exists but
isn&rsquo;t upstream, Micrium uC/OS is available, as is ThreadX.</li><li>Debugging: GDB port upstream, OpenOCD exists but not upstream. Also
commercial debuggers: Segger, Lauterbach, UltraSoC, IAR is upcoming.</li><li>The core software stack has been supported by a consortium of developers
from a range of companies.</li><li>RISC-V software implementations: Spike, RV8, Renode, QEMU (upstreamed and
included in a upstream release about a week ago)</li><li>There are also commercial simulators, such as Imperas OVP and Esperanto&rsquo;s
simulator.</li><li>Help wanted: OpenJDK JIT port, Arduino runtime</li><li>The RISC-V platform specification working group will define profiles for
types of RISC-V systems. e.g. bare-metal embedded, RTOS, embedded Linux,
portable Linux.</li></ul><h2 id=the-risc-v-vector-isa-update-roger-espassa:2362d622cd60bdb9d5eb8a1222aae504>The RISC-V vector ISA update: Roger Espassa</h2><ul><li>The spec isn&rsquo;t yet ready&hellip;but it&rsquo;s getting really close</li><li>Updates and discussion points:<ul><li>Register types moved to an extension.</li><li>Widening multiplies</li><li>Debating whether reductions should be in base or not</li><li>Worked on overlaying V-reg and F-reg to save state, decided against it</li><li>Fixed point vclip instructions</li><li>Mask support for speculative vectorisation</li><li>Possibility to fit integer MADD within encoding</li></ul></li><li>Scalar support: the encoding allows indicating that the destination vreg is
a &ldquo;scalar shape&rdquo;. Introduce VLO/VSO to load/store single scalar elements.</li><li>Roger is outlining the newly introduced instructions. I can&rsquo;t usefully
summarise these, so you&rsquo;re best waiting for the slides to be published.</li><li>vclip is introduced to help support fixed point.</li><li>FP16 operations are introduced and are required for the V extension.</li><li>The vector extension introduces interesting instructions such as vector-fpr
merge, vector-fp merge, slide down / slide up</li><li>Plan to close the base spec very soon</li><li>Want to see compiler output before bringing for ratification</li><li>Haven&rsquo;t yet started on formal spec for the vector ISA</li></ul><h2 id=the-isa-formal-spec-technical-update-rishiyur-nikhil:2362d622cd60bdb9d5eb8a1222aae504>The ISA formal spec technical update: Rishiyur Nikhil</h2><ul><li>What what use is an ISA formal spec?<ul><li>Answer questions about compiler correctness. Will executing a certain two
C programs produce the same results? For all inputs? For all C and
corresponding RISC-V programs?</li><li>Answer questions on implementation correctness. Will executing this progam
produce correct results? On all RISC-V processors?</li></ul></li><li>ISA formal spec goals<ul><li>Clear and understandable to the human reader. Precise and complete.
Machine readable. Executable (run RISC-V programs, boot an OS). Usable with
various formal tools.</li></ul></li><li>Key issues<ul><li>RISC-V&rsquo;s modularity. A wide range of options, some of which are
dynamically selectable or can vary between privilege levels. The spec needs
to capture all combinations and still remain readable.</li><li>Extensibility. Want to allow people to build upon the formal spec to add
support their own extensions.</li><li>Non-detterminism and concurrency.</li></ul></li><li>Status. Various approaches are being pursued: 3 projects in Haskell, 1
project in SAIL, 1 project in L3, another in a &lsquo;functional subset&rsquo; of Verilog<ul><li>One of the Haskell projects (led by a team at MIT) is furthest along.
Models RV32I, RV64I, M, priv U+S+M, Sv39 VM</li></ul></li><li>Next steps: within a couple of months publish a formal spec that is complete
for RV32IMAC, RV64IMAC, user+supervisor+machine mode, sv32+sv39, and a simple
sequential memory model. Liaise with the compliance group to use the formal
spec as a golden reference for compliance suites. Then work to integrate with
the weak memory model.</li><li>Potential follow-up projects (by community?)<ul><li>Formally show equivalences between different ISA formalisations</li><li>Demonstrate extensibility to other standard options (e.g. vector, crypto)</li><li>Use it!

&hellip;)</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=risc-v-memory-consistency-model-status-update-dan-lustig:2362d622cd60bdb9d5eb8a1222aae504>RISC-V memory consistency model status update: Dan Lustig</h2><ul><li>The specification is released for public comment, which will run through to
June 16th.</li><li>Fundamentally, the RISC-V memory consistency model specifies the values that
can be returned by loads.</li><li>The RISC-V memory model specification defines the RISC-V weak memory
ordering (RVWMO) model and extensions: Zam (misaligned atomics), Ztso (Total
Store Ordering).</li><li>Global memory order (GMO): a total order over the memory operations
generated by the instructions in each program</li><li>GMO is constrained by the Preserved Program Order (PPO)</li><li>Load Value Axiom</li><li>Atomicity Axiom: no store from another hart can appear in the global memory
order between a paired LR and successful SC (see spec for full details of
rule)</li><li>Progress Axiom: no memory operation may be preceded in the global memory
order by an infinite sequence of other memory operations</li><li>Misaligned AMOs are not supported in the base &lsquo;A&rsquo; extension, but can be
supported with the &lsquo;Zam&rsquo; extension.</li><li>Ztso strengthens the baseline memory model to TSO, but TSO-only code is not
backwards-compatible with RVWMO.</li><li>Authored two appendices which give lengthy explanations in plain English as
well as axiomatic and operational models. More than 7000 litmus tests are
available online.</li><li>Ongoing/future work<ul><li>Mixed-size, partially overlappy memory accesses</li><li>Instruction fetches and fence.i, TL flushes and sfence.vma etc</li><li>Integrations with V, J, N, T extensions</li><li>&hellip;</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=software-drives-hardware-lessons-learned-and-future-directions-robert-oshana:2362d622cd60bdb9d5eb8a1222aae504>Software drives hardware. Lessons learned and future directions: Robert Oshana</h2><ul><li>Software engineers can innovate earlier/often and drive more specific core
requirements for hardware design team</li><li>Software engineers like to dream of a simple single core running at very
high clock rate, and zero latency unlimited bandwidth access to a single
memory. A hardware engineers dreams of many cores at 1ghz with accelerators,
separate memories etc.</li><li>Trying to achieve even faster development cycles.</li><li>Start with system modelling, move to system definition, and produce
intrinsic libraries, new instructions, programming model details, and a Chisel
model.</li><li>Moving towards &ldquo;software driven hardware&rdquo; to support the software
programming model (2020).</li><li>NXP are using PULPino.</li><li>Challenge: establishing a robust open community for RISC-V. Want to see
multiple vendors contributing back to the &lsquo;RISC-V ISA mainline&rsquo;.</li><li>Using RISC-V mainly as &lsquo;minion cores&rsquo;. Focused on efficient core designs and
ISA enhancement for application-specific functionality. e.g. bit manipulation,
crypto. Other innovation targets include a multi RISC-V core MCU SoC.</li><li>Embedded software engineers will take a bigger role in defining the SoC
architecture<ul><li>Programming model</li><li>System optimsiation</li></ul></li><li>Open source RISC-V implementations will allow more software driven hardware.
Ecosystem is vital to success.</li></ul><h2 id=unleashing-the-power-of-data-with-risc-v-martin-fink:2362d622cd60bdb9d5eb8a1222aae504>Unleashing the power of data with RISC-V: Martin Fink</h2><ul><li>Why has Western Digital made such a big commitment to RISC-V even though
they&rsquo;re not in the processor business? Feel there&rsquo;s too much focus on the CPU,
when the focus needs to be on the data.</li><li>Half the world&rsquo;s data lives on Western Digital devices.</li><li>First Western Digital RISC-V core. 2-way superscalar, mostly in-order core
with 9 stage pipeline. RV32IMC, 1 load/store pipe, 1 multiplier, 1 divider, 4
ALU engines.<ul><li>Performance targets at 28nm. Dhrystone greater than 2MIPS/Mhz, CoreMark
over 3 CM/MH. 1GHz operation.</li><li>Built to show it can be done and better understand RISC-V</li><li>Most of the work went into the uncore.</li></ul></li><li>Produced a NAND controller SoC using RISC-V. Added instruction optimisations
for NAND media handling.</li><li>Still on track to ship first products with RISC-V in 2019.</li><li>RISC-V in embedded<ul><li>Free and open IP connectivity buses enabling plug and play of proprietary
and open source IPs</li></ul></li><li>RISC-V in enterprise<ul><li>Datacenter CPUs with smart, fast and open peripheral buses enable new
compute paradigms for AI workloads</li></ul></li><li>General purpose architectures are no longer sufficient. Workload diversity
demands diverse technologies and architectures.</li><li>Open source software licenses can apply to HDL, GDSII, Gerber. There is more
work still needed though.</li><li>Strong believer in the GPLv2. The troubling part about permissive licensing
is it allows people to do proprietary things without sharing. Pragmatically,
many companies gravitate towards permissive licenses like Apache. Hope to move
work word towards copyleft over time.</li><li>Western Digital is working to support development of open source IP building
blocks for the community. Will actively partner and invest in the ecosystem.
Accelerate development of purpose-built processors for a broad range of Big
Data and Fast Data environments.</li><li>There is a multi-year transition of Western Digital devices, platforms and
systems to RISC-V.</li><li>Question from the audience: will Western Digital be open sourcing their
cores? Would like to, but not making a commitment today. One of the challenges
is uncoupling from the uncore. Ultimately hope to share cores and IP blocks.</li></ul><h2 id=risc-v-debugging-custom-isa-extensions-multicore-dtm-variants-markus-goehrle:2362d622cd60bdb9d5eb8a1222aae504>RISC-V debugging.

active inferiors with their own flow of control and address space. Each
inferior is associated with a program space (symbol table and DWARF debug
information) for the code running on that inferior.</li><li>Upstream GDB supports multiple concurrent inferiors which has been tested
for RISC-V with a 36-core system. More work is needed for complex address

power.</li><li>Evaluated the architecture using low cost FPGA boards (ZedBoard, Zybo,
Arty).</li><li>Moved the instruction SRAM out of the processor die, and evaluate the
performance effect of different widths between processor and external SRAM.
Ended up using an 8-bit bus configuration.</li><li>Improved SHA256 performance by adding a hwardware engine.</li><li>Made a debug chip packaged in QFP64 wire-bond</li><li>Currently testing the 2.5D integrated device</li><li>The second generation device was taped out in Feb 2018, featuring a new SoC
design with instruction cache, RF interface, sensors.</li></ul><h2 id=poster-and-demo-previews:2362d622cd60bdb9d5eb8a1222aae504>Poster and demo previews</h2><ul><li>Far too fast-paced to summarise. Be sure to come back tomorrow for a new
