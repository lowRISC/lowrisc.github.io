We prioritise robust engineering and documentation, created through open processes, and act as a neutral non-profit home for collaborations. This attracts partners to build shared silicon infrastructure for large scale applications and free adoption by anyone, growing and strengthening a diverse ecosystem.</p><section><div class=col><h2>Open source for sustainability</h2><div class=lead><p>Our longstanding participation in open source development means that we recognise the importance of maintenance and community, and so we design support for these in up front. lowRISC is striving to bring the best of the open source movement and digital working practices to the hardware world, whilst respecting the challenges of designing and manufacturing physical products.
As an example, Rob Mullins brings lots of experience to lowRISC, being both a co-founder of lowRISC and of Raspberry Pi.
Both software and hardware are essential for an open source silicon future, and we are building an open culture which welcomes participation from everyone across different organisations, backgrounds and experience levels. The lowRISC community is friendly and we seek to support each other to learn and collaborate well. We hope to be part of active, collaborative development communities with a broad range of contributors, much as is seen in successful open source software projects.</p></div></div><div class="col-md-5 align-self-center"><img srcset="https://www.lowrisc.org/our-work/team-collab1_hu7d9c9c56ce74c465d9e6ce0347e37556_9004551_500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 1x, https://www.lowrisc.org/our-work/team-collab1_hu7d9c9c56ce74c465d9e6ce0347e37556_9004551_1000x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 2x" src=https://www.lowrisc.org/our-work/team-collab1_hu7d9c9c56ce74c465d9e6ce0347e37556_9004551_500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt="lowRISC team at work" title="lowRISC team at work" class="featurette-image img-fluid mx-auto"></div></section><h2>Research and development</h2><p>lowRISC seeks to make the most of the efficiencies and benefits of open-source hardware. In particular, we are exploring new ideas in the areas of computer architecture, security, compilers and EDA tools, collaborating on research with universities to explore novel features in security and more. We are also keen to share our open source artifacts with others to help them prove and implement new ideas. We believe that academia in particular can benefit from access to our industry quality open IP, and from the ability to transition open-source IP from the laboratory to lowRISC for continued development and support.</p></div></section><section style=padding-top:20px><div class=col><h2 class=featurette-heading>lowRISC Projects</h2><div class=lead>Our engineering team works on various projects, some hosted at lowRISC and some which are lead elsewhere.
