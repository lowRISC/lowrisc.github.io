This is a student design contest which aims to recognise and reward contributions to the open source hardware ecosystem. The main evaluation criteria are:
Openness. Your work must be published under an established Open Source license. Reusability. How easily can your work be used and modified by someone else? Is it well documented?</p><p><a href=/blog/2016/06/announcing-the-librecores-design-contest-and-orconf-2016/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/blog/2016/06/lowriscs-2016-google-summer-of-code-students/>lowRISC&#39;s 2016 Google Summer of Code Students</a></h2><p class=text-justify>The 2016 Google Summer of Code is now underway and we&rsquo;re delighted to be working with five students, covering a variety of interesting projects. They have all introduced themselves over the past few weeks on our project mailing list. Many thanks to everyone who applied, to the mentors who volunteered, and to Google for sponsoring this programme. If your application was unsuccessful, I hope you&rsquo;ll try again next year.
The projects for lowRISC in the 2016 GSoC are:</p><p><a href=/blog/2016/06/lowriscs-2016-google-summer-of-code-students/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/blog/2016/03/apply-now-to-work-with-lowrisc-in-google-summer-of-code/>Apply now to work with lowRISC in Google Summer of Code</a></h2><p class=text-justify>We are very grateful to have been selected to take part as a mentoring organisation in the Google Summer of Code for the second year running. As with last year, we&rsquo;re working with a number of friends from across the wider open source hardware community to act as an umbrella for a range of hardware-related projects. If you are a student who would like to be paid to work on open source during the summer, then take a look at the lowRISC ideas list and apply.</p><p><a href=/blog/2016/03/apply-now-to-work-with-lowrisc-in-google-summer-of-code/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/blog/2016/01/third-risc-v-workshop-day-two/>Third RISC-V Workshop: Day Two</a></h2><p class=text-justify>Today is the second day of the third RISC-V workshop.

Introductions and RISC-V Foundation Overview: Rick O&rsquo;Connor Save the date, the 4th RISC-V workshop will be July 12th-13th at the MIT CSAIL/Stata Center. In August 2015, articles of incorporation were filed to create a non-profit RISC-V Foundation to govern the ISA.</p><p><a href=/blog/2016/01/third-risc-v-workshop-day-one/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/blog/2015/12/untethered-lowrisc-release/>Untethered lowRISC release</a></h2><p class=text-justify>Over the past several months, we&rsquo;ve been working to provide a standalone or &lsquo;untethered&rsquo; SoC. Cores in the original Rocket chip rely on communicating with a companion processor via the host-target interface (HTIF) to access peripherals and I/O. This release removes this requirement, adding an I/O bus and instantiating FPGA peripherals. The accompanying tutorial, written by Wei Song, describes how to build this code release and explains the underlying structural changes.</p><p><a href=/blog/2015/12/untethered-lowrisc-release/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/blog/2015/08/lowrisc-at-orconf-2015/>lowRISC at ORConf 2015</a></h2><p class=text-justify>Please join us October 9th-11th in Geneva, Switzerland for ORConf 2015. The event is kindly being hosted by CERN at the IdeaSquare. Last year&rsquo;s ORConf was home to the first public talk on lowRISC and we&rsquo;re delighted this year it will also be hosting a series of lowRISC and RISC-V discussions, serving as a European lowRISC and RISC-V workshop. ORConf has in recent years grown to cover a range of open source hardware topics beyond the original OpenRISC focus.</p><p><a href=/blog/2015/08/lowrisc-at-orconf-2015/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/blog/2015/06/second-risc-v-workshop-day-two/>Second RISC-V Workshop: Day Two</a></h2><p class=text-justify>It&rsquo;s the second day of the second RISC-V workshop today in Berkeley, California.

Z-scale. Tiny 32-bit RISC-V Systems: Yunsup Lee Z-Scale is a family of tiny cores, similar in spirit to the ARM Cortex-M family. It integrates with the AHB-Lite interconnect. Contrast to Rocket (in-order cores, 64-bit, 32-bit, dual-issue options), and BOOM (a family of out-of-order cores).</p><p><a href=/blog/2015/06/second-risc-v-workshop-day-two/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/blog/2015/06/second-risc-v-workshop-day-one/>Second RISC-V Workshop: Day One</a></h2><p class=text-justify>The second RISC-V workshop is going on today and tomorrow in Berkeley, California.

Introductions and welcome: Krste Asanović The beginning of Krste&rsquo;s talk will be familiar for anyone who&rsquo;s seen an introduction to RISC-V before. Pleasingly, there are a lot of new faces here at the workshop so the introduction of course makes a lot of sense.</p><p><a href=/blog/2015/06/second-risc-v-workshop-day-one/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/blog/2015/05/summer-of-code-students-for-lowrisc/>Summer of Code students for lowRISC</a></h2><p class=text-justify>lowRISC was fortunate enough to be chosen as a mentoring organisation in this year&rsquo;s Google Summer of Code. The Google Summer of Code program funds students to work on open source projects over the summer. We had 52 applications across the range of project ideas we&rsquo;ve been advertising. As you can see from the range of project ideas, lowRISC is taking part as an umbrella organisation, working with a number of our friends in the wider open source software and hardware community.</p><p><a href=/blog/2015/05/summer-of-code-students-for-lowrisc/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><div class=lr-blog-list-pagination><ul class=pagination><li class=page-item><a href=/blog/ class=page-link aria-label=First><span aria-hidden=true>&laquo;&laquo;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/blog/page/4/ class=page-link aria-label=Previous><span aria-hidden=true>&laquo;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/blog/>1</a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/blog/page/2/>2</a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/blog/page/3/>3</a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/blog/page/4/>4</a></li><li class="page-item active"><a class=page-link href=/blog/page/5/>5</a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/blog/page/6/>6</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/blog/page/6/ class=page-link aria-label=Next><span aria-hidden=true>&raquo;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/blog/page/6/ class=page-link aria-label=Last><span aria-hidden=true>&raquo;&raquo;</span></a></li></ul></div></div></main><footer class=lr-footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-2 d-none d-lg-block"><img src=/img/logo/logo-dualcolor.svg width=150px></div><div class=col><p>The text content on this website is licensed under a <a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>, except where otherwise noted.
