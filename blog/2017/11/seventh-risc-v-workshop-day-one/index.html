<p>The <a href="https://riscv.org/2017/10/7th-risc-v-workshop-agenda/">seventh RISC-V
workshop</a> is going
on today and tomorrow at Western Digital in Milpitas. I&rsquo;ll be
keeping a semi-live blog of talks and announcements throughout the day.</p>

<p>Follow <a href="http://www.lowrisc.org/blog/2017/11/seventh-risc-v-workshop-day-two">here</a> for the
day two live blog.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-rick-o-conor:c2b101a090d7cc5ec0df656eac1944a4">Introduction: Rick O&rsquo;Conor</h2>

<ul>
<li>Workshop is sold out, 498 attendees registered representing 138 companies
and 35 universities.</li>
<li>There will be 47 sessions squeezed into 12 and 24 minute increments, plus 26
poster / demo sessions.</li>
<li>The 8th RISC-V workshop will be held on May 7th-10th at the Barcelona
Supercomputing Center and Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya.</li>
<li>Rick gives a refresher on the structure of the RISC-V Foundation.</li>
<li>The RISC-V Foundation now has only 100 members (including individual
members).</li>
<li>We&rsquo;re on a <em>tight</em> schedule today. No applause and no questions!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="risc-v-state-of-the-union-krste-asanovic:c2b101a090d7cc5ec0df656eac1944a4">RISC-V state of the union: Krste Asanovic</h2>

<ul>
<li>Krste gives a rapid overview of the RISC-V ISA.</li>
<li>RISC-V aims to be simple, clean-slate, modulary, and stable.</li>
<li>RISC-V started in May 2010. v1.0 of the ISA came in 2011, first Rocket
tapeout in 2012, first Linux port in 2013, v2.0 (frozen) IMAFD spec in 2014.
First commercial softcores and first commercial SoC in 2017.</li>
<li>Large companies are adopting RISC-V for deeply embedded controllers in their
SoCs (&ldquo;minion cores&rdquo;), replacing home-grown and commercial cores.

<ul>
<li>[Editor&rsquo;s note: pleasing to see the &ldquo;minion core&rdquo; name take off around the
wider RISC-V community!].</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Small and proprietary-ISA soft-core IP companies are switching to the RISC-V
standard to access a larger market. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re a softcore IP provider, you
should have a RISC-V product in development&rdquo;.</li>
<li>RISC-V has seen government adoption, e.g. India adopted it as a national
ISA. A recent security-focused DARPA project standardised on RISC-V. Israel
Innovation Authority are creating the GenPro platform around RISC-V.</li>
<li>Many startups are choosing RISC-V for new products. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t had to tell
startups about RISC-V; they find out about it very quickly when shopping for
processor IP&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Commercial ecosystem providers: starting to see mainstream commercial
support. &ldquo;Demand is driving supply in the commercial ecosystem&rdquo;.</li>
<li>RISC-V in academic research: becoming the standard ISA for academic
research. There will be talks at the workshop about the Celerity 500 RISC-V
core SoC in 16nm FinFET, and FireSim which models 1024 quad-core RISC-V
servers in the cloud.

<ul>
<li>The CARRV RISC-V workshop at MICRO was even better attended than the
machine learning workshop.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Expect in a few years time that the vast majority of undergraduates will be
taught RISC-V at University.</li>
<li>Racepoint Global have been hired for Foundation marketing.</li>
<li>RISC-V Technical Roadmap for 2017:

<ul>
<li>Primary goal was to formally standardise the base ISA, resolve issues with
the memory model, debug, and stabilize the privileged architecture.</li>
<li>Good progress has been made, but the spec hasn&rsquo;t yet been ratified. One of
the issues is differentiating the base spec versus clarifications for
different &ldquo;profiles&rdquo;. There is no plan to change any instruction
specification versus 2.0.</li>
<li>The Unix platform is stable as of the privileged 1.10 spec (i.e. no
backwards incompatible changes from now on).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>ISA specifications and profiles

<ul>
<li>The original ISA specs mixed instruction specifications with platform
mandates. Now work is ongoing to separate instruction set specifications
from platform profiles.</li>
<li>Instruction set specifications should be maximally reusable, while the
profiles should be as constrained as possible to simplify software
compatibility.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Single-letter names will run out some day, so a proposal has been made to
allow finer-grained naming of instruction sets to describe profiles. Use Zxxxx
to name standard instruction extensions (while Xyyyyy is used for non-standard
instruction extensions). See the isa-dev list for more information.</li>
<li>Profiles for software compatibility. A software ABI/SBI defines a profile.
A software ABI/SBI defines a profile. Also need profiles M-mode-only
microcontrollers, and MU-mode microcontrollers, and for booting MSU platforms.
Aim for have first ready in Q12018.</li>
<li>Memory model: the original was too weak for C11 and underspecified, but a
team of experts have come together over the past year to resolve the issues.
RVWMO is the base memory model and is weak, while RVTSO is an optional
extension providing a strong TSO memory model.</li>
<li>Calling convention and ABI has been stabilized and documented.</li>
<li>GCC and binutils have been upstreamed and released in GCC. LLVM upstream is
in progress.</li>
<li>A number of other compilers and languages are now available. e.g. CompCert,
Go, Rust, OCaml, Jikes JVM, OpenJDK, &hellip;</li>
<li>The Linux port has been accepted upstream for the 4.15 release.
Additionally, the hypervisor spec has been released (designed to support
recursive virtualisation using an enhanced S mode).</li>
<li>Run-halt debug going well, is being targeted by commercial vendors.</li>
<li>2017 summary: All planned major technical decisions settled, some more work
on the ratification process is needed.</li>
<li>Technical roadmap goals for 2018:

<ul>
<li>Complete ratification of base ISA and first profiles</li>
<li>Base vector extensions proposed and ratified</li>
<li>Hypervisor implemented, spec ratified</li>
<li>Formal spec completed and released</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Vector: see the talk from Roger. Aim to be the Best Vector ISA Ever &trade;.</li>
<li>Security: really two separable efforts in the foundation: trusted execution
environments and cryptographic instruction extensions. Also a huge amount of
other work in the academic community.</li>
<li>Interrupts: currently have fast local interrupts and global platform-level
interrupts. Also have requests for high end systems who want per-hart
message-signal interrupts (MSI) and from low-end embedded that want
pre-emptive vectored prioritized interrupts.</li>
<li>Improving embedded compression: the C extension was designed for general
purpose computing with Unix binaries. People are seeing non-competitive RISC-V
code size on pure embedded workloads, like due to lack of byte/halfword memory
access? Considering an alternative C extension for RV32E systems.</li>
<li>A new task group has been up for the &lsquo;J&rsquo; extension, exploring support for
dynamically translated languages. Looking at issues like integer overflow,
garbage collection, and instruction cache management.</li>
<li>Summary

<ul>
<li>Very rapid development and adoption &ldquo;by the time you decide to do a
project, support will be there&rdquo;.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Question: does the foundation have any formal ways of addressing IP
challenges? Answer: have been documenting prior art for the base ISA
instructions. Would be good to continue to expand this to cover reference
hardware implementations.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="risc-v-hyupervisor-extension-andrew-waterman:c2b101a090d7cc5ec0df656eac1944a4">RISC-V Hyupervisor Extension: Andrew Waterman</h2>

<ul>
<li>Presenting work with extensive contributions from Paolo Bonzini and John
Hauser</li>
<li>Goal is to virtualize S-mode to support running guest OSes under Type-1,
Type-2 and hybrid hypervisors. Also want to be high performance and to support
recursive virtualisation.</li>
<li>The hypervisor extension adds new privileged modes. S-mode becomes HS-mode,
and we also add the Virtualised Supervisor (VS) and Virtualized User (VU)
modes.</li>
<li>What needs to be virtualized? Supervisor architecture state (CSRs), memory,
I/O and interrupts.</li>
<li>Additional copies of most supervisor CSrs are provisioned as background
supervisor CSRs, e.g. bsscratch, bsepc. In HS-mode, foreground CSRs contain
S-mode state and background CSRs contain inactive VS-mode state. These are
swapped in VS-mode.</li>
<li>Use two-level address translation to virtualize memory. Original virtual
addresses are translated to guest physical addresses by the VS-level page
table, and then guest physical addresses are translated to machine physical
addresses by the HS-level page table.

<ul>
<li>Page table entry formats and page table layouts are the same as S-mode</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Software and timer interrupts are easy to virtualise, as they&rsquo;re already
exposed via the SBI. The two-level paging scheme can be used to trap MMIO
accesses.

<ul>
<li>Could avoid extra traps into the hypervisor with a virtualisation-aware
PLIC. This is considered a platform issues, outside of the scope of the
hypervisor ISA.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Need an I/O MMU to initiated DMAs without trap into the hypervisor - also a
platform issue.</li>
<li>The hypervisor extension is designed to be efficiently emulatable on M/S/U
systems with traps into M-mode.</li>
<li>Specification v.01 is <a href="https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual">available on
GitHub</a>. Hoping to implement in
Spike in Q1 2018.</li>
<li>Want to see a silicon implementation prior to ratification.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="risc-v-memory-consistency-model-status-update-dan-lustig:c2b101a090d7cc5ec0df656eac1944a4">RISC-V memory consistency model status update: Dan Lustig</h2>

<ul>
<li>The goal was to define the RISC-V memory consistency model (&ldquo;specifies the
values that can be returned by loads&rdquo;). Support a wide range of hardware
implementations, as well as Linux, C/C++ and lots of other critical software.</li>
<li>The fundamental debate was about strong models (such as x86-TSO) vs weak
models (ARM, IBM Power). Strong models have stricter ordering rules, resulting
in something that&rsquo;s simpler for programmers and for architects. Weak models
have more relaxed ordering rules, better performance/power/area and more
microarchitectural freedom.</li>
<li>In order to find a compromise, defined RVTSO (strong) and RVWMO (weak).

<ul>
<li>Both are multi-copy atomic. This means cores are allowed to peek at stores
they have issues as long as they haven&rsquo;t been observed by anyone else and is
much simpler to reason about than the Power and ARMv7 memory models.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The base RISC-V memory model is RVWMO (software must assume this if it wants
to be portable). It&rsquo;s important to note that a hardware implementation meeting
the RVWMO specification could be more conservative (stronger). Additional have
the Ztso extension for RVTSO, which software might target.</li>
<li>RVWMO and RVTSO differ in the degree of memory access reordering they permit
at the point of global visibility. In RVTSO, only store-to-load reordering can
be observed. In RVWMO, most memory accesses can be reordered freely unless
synchronized via .sq, .rl and/or fences.</li>
<li>Dan has some handy diagrams that explain the RVWMO and RVTSO rules in a
nutshell, which you should be able to study once the slides become available.</li>
<li>Software written for RVWMO will run on all RISC-V hardware (RVWMO and Ztso).
RVTSO-only software can be be written, but will only run on hardware
implementing Ztso. A flag in the ELF header will be used to ensure this.</li>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t want to think about memory models, just use the standard OSes
and toolchains. If you care about PPA or flexibility, use RVWMO. If you have
lots of legacy x86 code, use hardware implementing Ztso so that any software
will work. If you believe TSO is the future, use hardware with Ztso and emit
code with the TSO-only magic number.</li>
<li>Fragmentation due to the presence of two memory models is an obvious risk.
Try to discourage software from targeting both, and encourage targeting RVWMO
wherever possible (redundant fences simple become no-ops).</li>
<li>There have been a number of other ISA changes. ld.rl and sd.aq are
deprecated. ld.aqrl and sd.aqrl mean RCsc. Also clarified other subtleties.
May have future extensions to the fence instruction, and .aq/.rl variants for
byte and halfware-size loads/stores.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="risc-v-enabling-a-new-era-of-open-data-centric-computing-architectures-martin-fink:c2b101a090d7cc5ec0df656eac1944a4">RISC-V - Enabling a new era of open data-centric computing architectures: Martin Fink</h2>

<ul>
<li>Most people think of Western Digital as a storage company, but actually
they&rsquo;re a <em>data</em> company.</li>
<li>Big data is well known, but increasingly there are applications that require
&ldquo;fast data&rdquo; (immediate access to information).</li>
<li>Big data applications have historically focused on general purpose compute.
But we need to be able to move beyond general purpose compute to meet new
application requirements.</li>
<li>In a general purpose compute architecture, everything is centered around the
CPU rather than the data.</li>
<li>Workload diversity demands diverse technologies and architectures, both for
&ldquo;big data&rdquo; and &ldquo;fast data&rdquo;.</li>
<li>There are a wide range of data-centric applications at the edge.</li>
<li>RISC-V meets the needs of big data (move compute to data) and fast data
(memory centric compute). It enables purpose-built environments for big data
and fast data applications.</li>
<li>Western Digital ships in excess of 1 billion cores per year, and expect to
double that. They are making a commitment to transition all of those 1 billion
cores towards RISC-V, across their whole product portfolio.</li>
<li>Want to process the data where it lives, which RISC-V will help to enable.</li>
<li>Represents a new style of development. In some cases, WD may develop their
own cores, in others may buy them, in others may partner with another company
to co-develop them.</li>
<li>Western Digital will work to accelerate the RISC-V ecosystem:

<ul>
<li>Support the development of open source IP building blocks for the
community</li>
<li>Actively partner and invest in the ecosystem</li>
<li>Accelerate development of purpose-built processors for a broad range of
Big Data and Fast Data environments</li>
<li>Multi-year transition of Western Digital devices, platforms and systems to
RISC-V purpose built architectures</li>
</ul></li>
<li>First device from WD with a RISC-V core is likely to not ship until late
2019 to early 2020.</li>
<li>Summary

<ul>
<li>Big Data and Fast Data need purpose-built environments</li>
<li>Openness and ecosystem enable best-in-class innovation. The motivation is
enabling innovation, <em>not</em> reducing cost.</li>
<li>Western Digital brings the momentum of other 1B cores per year</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Coming out of &ldquo;stealth mode&rdquo; in this talk.</li>
<li>Chris Celio is joining Esperanto, but will continue to maintain and support
BOOM. Esperanto will also be implementing even higher performance out-of-order
processors.</li>
<li>Esperanto have been pursuing an implementing of the draft Vector ISA in
order to understand design trade-offs.</li>
<li>RISC-V is off to a great start, but many in industry view RISC-V as a
curiosity or toy, only for low end. Repeatedly see questions about high-end
designs (in Verilog!), graphics, machine learning, or HPC applications.</li>
<li>See Esperanto as complementing existing core vendors, &ldquo;expanding RISC-V&rsquo;s
piece of the pie&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Experanto is designing a high-performance RISC-V core comparable to the best
IP alternatives. It is designing an energy-efficient RISC-V core for high
TeraFLOP computing needs. The goal is to make RISC-V more compelling than the
other high-end alternatives.</li>
<li>Will produce IP with human readable, synthesizable Verilog.</li>
<li>Esperanto is building the highest TeraFLOPS per Watt machine learning
computing system, and it will be based on the RISC-V ISA</li>
<li>ET-Maxion will be the highest single thread performance 64-bit RISC-V
processor. Starting from BOOM v2, but expect substantial changes. Optimized
for 7nm CMOS. This will be used in Esperanto&rsquo;s products and made available as
a licensable core.</li>
<li>Second core is the ET-Minion. This is intended to do all the heavy floating
point work, with very high floating point throughput and energy efficiency.
This will be a 64-bit RISC-V core with vector extensions, an in-order
pipeline, and extra instruction extensions for machine learning. Also have
multiple hardware threads of execution. Like the ET-Maxion, this will be used
in Esperanto products and available as a licensable core.</li>
<li>Putting these together in a product: Esperanto&rsquo;s AI supercomputer on a chip.
16 64-bit ET-Maxion RISC-V cores with private L1 and L2 caches, 4096 64-bit
ET-Minion RISC-V cores each with their own vector floating point unit,
hardware accelerators, Network on Chip to allow processors to reside in the
same address space, multiple levels of cache, etc.</li>
<li>Other companies are proposing special purpose hardware for machine learning
using proprietary instruction sets. Esperanto want to base all processing on
RISC-V, adding instruction extensions and hardware accelerators where
necessary.</li>
<li>Also looked at using RISC-V for graphics. Wrote a shader cmpiler that can
generate RISC-V compilers, and the code to distribute the workload across
thousands of cores.</li>
<li>Argue that proprietary, custom instruction sets are a bad choice. Instead,
make general purpose RISC-V processors with domain specific extensions when
needed.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Jikes RVM now runs full JDK6 applications, including the Decapo benchmark
suite. Passes the Jikes RVM core test suite. About 15000 lines of code.</li>
<li>Managed languages have been under-represented in computer architecture
research for quite some time.</li>
<li>Challenges: long running on many cores, concurrent tasks, fine-grained
interactions. Difficult fit for many common simulation approaches, e.g. Qemu
or Gem5.</li>
<li>Instead, we can run managed workloads on real RISC-V hardware in FPGA-based
simulation to enable modifying the entire stack.</li>
<li>By modifying the hardware, we can do fine-grained tracing without perturbing
the software being tested.</li>
<li>Can explore the interaction with the memory system, e.g. DRAM row misses
encountered during garbage collection.</li>
<li>This will allow a wide range of research that was difficult without this
infrastructure.</li>
<li>Have the Jikes Research VM (baseline JIT, no optimising JIT). Can run
OpenJDK Hotspot JVM with the Zero (interpreter) backend, but no
high-performance JIT compiler port yet. Help needed!</li>
<li>The RISC-V Foundation has launched the J extension working group today, to
better support managed-language support to RISC-V.</li>

<ul>
<li>Not yet open source, but in the process of releasing it.</li>
<li>Why make microbenchmarks? Might want to study worst case power consumption,
look for performance bugs, determine if the design is reliable, &hellip; But
writing microbenchmarks is a labour-intensive process.</li>
<li>MicroProbe has the user write microbenchmark generation policies. The
framework then produces benchmarks according to those policies.</li>
<li>The target definition (ISA, microarchitecture, environment) is written using
YAML. Code generation and generation policies are written using Python.</li>
<li>MicroProbe uses riscv-meta from Michael Clark.</li>
<li>The user describes a microbenchmark as transforms over an intermediate
representation (IR) for describing benchmarks.</li>

<ul>
<li>Extended Base Global Address Space (xBGAS)</li>
<li>Want to provide extended addressing capabilities without ruining the base
ABI.</li>
<li>Extended addressing must not specifically rely upon any one virtual memory</li>
<li>xBGAS is not a direct replacement for RV128.</li>
<li>See a variety of potential application domains.</li>
<li>HPC-PGAS: traditional message passing has a tremendous amount of overhead.
There are a range of low-latency PGAS runtimes, but little hardware/uarch
support.</li>
<li>Add extended (eN) register that map to base general registers. These are
manually utilized via extended load/store/move instructions.</li>
<li>You only get access to the extended address space when using the new
extended addressing instructions.</li>
<li>ISA extensions: base integer load/store, raw integer load/store, address
management (explicitly read/write the extended registers).</li>
<li>No support for things like atomics currently. (Question for the community:
how to define extensions to extensions?)</li>
<li>A number of outstanding issues with the ABI and calling convention. How to
link base RISC-V objects with objects containing extended addressing? Howe do
we address the caller/callee saved state with extended registers? What about
debugging and debugging metadata.</li>
<li>The software part of this is being led by the Data Intensive Scalable
Computing Lab at Texas Tech. Have a prototype implementation in LLVM.</li>
<li>Hardware part of the effort taking place at Tactical Computing Labs, LBNL
and MIT. Looking at pipelined and accelerator-based implementations.</li>
<li>The current spec is <a href="https://github.com/tactcomplabs/xbgas-archspec">available
here</a>. Comments and
collaborators are encouraged!</li>

<h2 id="extending-the-16-gpr-standard-beyond-rv32e-mitch-hayenga:c2b101a090d7cc5ec0df656eac1944a4">Extending the 16 GPR standard beyond RV32E: Mitch Hayenga</h2>

<ul>
<li>Motivation: Register file area/power/latency is critical to any processor.
Large register files help with static code scheduling, but wide issue
out-of-order processors have the potential to hide register spill latency and
issue bandwidth.</li>
<li>There are a number of commercially available cores that only offer 16
double-precision floating point registers.</li>
<li>Want to see the 16GPR option being orthogonal just like any other ISA
variant (RV32E currently can&rsquo;t be combined with the F and D extensions).</li>
<li>Reduced the available registers to x0-x15 and f0-f15. Modified GCC and glibc
and used gem5 with the Coremark/Dhrystone/Whetstone/Spec2006 benchmarks.</li>
<li>For the simple benchmarks, saw a 6-8% increase in static code size. Smaller
increase in dynamic instructions (and Whetstone saw a reduction). Saw in-order
execution time impacted, but much smaller impact for the out-of-order designs.</li>
<li>For SPECInt, saw (very) slightly improved code density and execution time.<br />
In perlbench this was primarily due to reduced function call overhead.</li>
<li>The impact was more negative for SPECFP.</li>
<li>Architectural overheads limit the viable design space of multithreaded
out-of-order CPUs.</li>
<li>New potential designs:

<ul>
<li>Dual-threaded, small window out-of-order CPUs (~20 instruction windows).
This is impractical with the current RISC-V register file size requirements</li>
<li>Large, high-IPC, many threaded CPU designs.</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>Hardware design is difficult. You need multiple codebases (cycle accurate,
high level simulation, verification reference model). Also need to adjust
pipeline stages and verify the hardware.</li>
<li>A new HDL (Pyrope) can help!</li>
<li>Fluid pipelines are the &ldquo;hammer&rdquo; used to address design complexity. Fluid
pipeline transformations change the number of stages as part of the compile
flow.</li>
<li>A fluid pipeline has valid/stop signals, and pipeline stages should tolerate
random delays.</li>
<li>Collapsing stages was useful in order to build an emulator out of a RISC-V
fluid core. Can also change the number of pipeline stages automatically, and
perform formal verification.</li>
<li>For a Verilog implementation, saw 2MIPS when compiling with Verilator. When
collapsing fluid pipelines to produce a fast emulator, saw 6MIPS. Spike
achieves around 12 MIPS.</li>
<li>Compared synthesis results of the fluid pipelines vs a range of open source
RISC-V cores.</li>
<li>For &ldquo;fluid verification&rdquo;, can collapse the stages in a RISC-V core, then
verify against a trivial single stage RISC-V core. Used yosys to do this.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>In multi-core architectures, core share resources such as L3, memory, and
I/O. This can cause uncertainties and QoS violations.</li>
<li>Take inspiration from labeled networks and try to apply to computer
architecture. Describe the Labeled von Neumann Architecture (LvNA).</li>
<li>Each request has a label, each label is correlated with a
process/thread/variable, labels are propagated across the whole machine, and
software-defined control logic is used to provide different service for
different labeled groups.</li>
<li>Proposed PARD (ASPLOS 2015). Programmable Architecture for
Resourcing-on-Demand.

<ul>
<li>Add a label register, allocate a label for each VM, attach a label to each
request, and add label-based programmable control logic.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>LvNA + RISC-V = Labeled RISC-V</li>
<li>Saw less than 3% overhead in terms of code, less than 5% resource overhead,
and no performance overheads for critical apps.</li>
<li>Plan to tape out with TSMC 40nm next year.</li>

<ul>
<li>PLIC design goals: easy integration with external bus interfaces, be fully
compliant, and very flexible. Should work from small microcontrollers all the
way up to large server applications.</li>
<li>The deign flexibility may result in management complexity. Potentially
hundreds or thousands of registers in a memory mapped management interface. So
try to define a management interface that minimises the memory map.</li>
<li>Create the memory map dynamically based on parameters given to the IP core.<br />
The register arrangement and documentation is automated.</li>
