Alongside his degree studies, Nikitas had become involved with the Libre Space Foundation and developed a strong interest in the possibility of open source hardware in CubeSats. Fault tolerance of some sort is important for harsh environments, and Nikitas worked to add fault tolerance through the implementation of core lockstep for the PULPino-based minion core subsystem.</p><p><a href=/blog/2017/10/gsoc-2017-student-report-core-lockstep-for-minion-cores/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/blog/2017/09/moving-risc-v-llvm-forwards/>Moving RISC-V LLVM forwards</a></h2><p class=text-justify>A high quality, upstream RISC-V backend for LLVM is perhaps the most frequently requested missing piece of the RISC-V software ecosystem. This blog post provides an update on the rapid progress we&rsquo;ve been making towards that goal, outlines next steps and upcoming events, and tries to better explain the approach that we&rsquo;re taking. As always, you can track status here and find the code here.

Katherine&rsquo;s focus was on operating system and software enabled for lowRISC&rsquo;s tagged memory, building upon our most recent milestone release. As Katherine&rsquo;s detailed write-up demonstrates, it&rsquo;s been a very productive summer.
The goal of this internship was to take the lowRISC hardware release, and demonstrate kernel support and software support for the hardware tagged memory primitives.</p><p><a href=/blog/2017/09/lowrisc-tagged-memory-os-enablement/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/blog/2017/09/were-hiring-work-on-making-open-source-hardware-a-reality/>We&#39;re hiring!

lowRISC C.I.C. is a not-for-profit company that aims to demonstrate, promote and support the use of open-source hardware. The lowRISC project was established in 2014 with the aim of bringing the benefits of open-source to the hardware world. It is working to do this by producing a high quality, secure, open, and flexible System-on-Chip (SoC) platform.</p><p><a href=/blog/2017/09/were-hiring-work-on-making-open-source-hardware-a-reality/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/blog/2017/09/building-upstream-risc-v-gccbinutilsnewlib-the-quick-and-dirty-way/>Building upstream RISC-V GCC&#43;binutils&#43;newlib: the quick and dirty way</a></h2><p class=text-justify>There are a number of available options for building a RISC-V GCC toolchain. You might use the build system from the riscv/riscv-tools repository, or investigate toolchain generators such as crosstool-ng. However in the case of riscv-tools, it&rsquo;s not always clear how this corresponds to the code in the relevant upstream projects. When investigating a potential bug, you often just want to build the latest upstream code with as little fuss as possible.</p><p><a href=/blog/2017/09/building-upstream-risc-v-gccbinutilsnewlib-the-quick-and-dirty-way/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/blog/2017/06/lowrisc-0-4-milestone-release/>lowRISC 0-4 milestone release</a></h2><p class=text-justify>The lowRISC 0.4 milestone release is now available. The various changes are best described in our accompanying documentation, but in summary this release:
Moves forward our support for tagged memory by re-integrating the tag cache, reducing overhead with a hierarchical scheme. This will significantly reduce caches misses caused by tagged memory accesses where tags are distributed sparsely. Integrates support for specifying and configuring tag propagation and exception behaviour. A PULPino based &ldquo;minion core&rdquo; has been integrated, and is used to provide peripherals such as the SD card interface, keyboard, and VGA tex display (when using the Nexys4 DDR FPGA development board).</p><p><a href=/blog/2017/06/lowrisc-0-4-milestone-release/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/blog/2017/03/apply-now-for-gsoc-2017/>Apply now for GSoC 2017</a></h2><p class=text-justify>We are very grateful for being selected again to take part as a mentoring organisation in the Google Summer of Code, now for the third year running. If you are a student who would like to be paid to work on open source during the summer, then take a look at the lowRISC ideas list and apply. The deadline for applications is 4pm UTC on April 3rd. We&rsquo;re always very interested in ideas suggested by students, and encourage you to share them on our discussion list for feedback before making a proposal.</p><p><a href=/blog/2017/03/apply-now-for-gsoc-2017/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><article class=media><div class=media-body><h2><a href=/blog/2017/02/2017-netfpga-design-challenge/>2017 NetFPGA Design Challenge</a></h2><p class=text-justify>As most of you know, the majority of full-time development on lowRISC takes place at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory.

OpenSoC System Architect: Farzad Fatollahi-Fard Current architectures are wasteful. Only a small fraction of chip area goes to computation. For both GoblinCore and OpenHPC, ended up doing a lot of similar work to achieve only a point design. Why not make a generator to avoid repeating the same steps?</p><p><a href=/blog/2016/11/fifth-risc-v-workshop-day-two/>Read More…</a></p></div></article><div class=lr-blog-list-pagination><ul class=pagination><li class=page-item><a href=/blog/ class=page-link aria-label=First><span aria-hidden=true>&laquo;&laquo;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/blog/page/3/ class=page-link aria-label=Previous><span aria-hidden=true>&laquo;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/blog/>1</a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/blog/page/2/>2</a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/blog/page/3/>3</a></li><li class="page-item active"><a class=page-link href=/blog/page/4/>4</a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/blog/page/5/>5</a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/blog/page/6/>6</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/blog/page/5/ class=page-link aria-label=Next><span aria-hidden=true>&raquo;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/blog/page/6/ class=page-link aria-label=Last><span aria-hidden=true>&raquo;&raquo;</span></a></li></ul></div></div></main><footer class=lr-footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-2 d-none d-lg-block"><img src=/img/logo/logo-dualcolor.svg width=150px></div><div class=col><p>The text content on this website is licensed under a <a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>, except where otherwise noted.
